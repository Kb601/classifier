general description for autumn 1996


 computer technology, the internet, and new methodologies
for teaching and learning are currently coming together in
new ways.  this seminar will explore a few of them.


 we will read a number of papers on technology for
collaborative learning.  each participating student will
take responsibility for making a presentation to the group on one of
these papers.  we will cover a subset of 

these papers.


 we will also explore some of the possible applications of
ai and visualization techniques to the analysis of evidence of
student learning in online contexts.





meetings are currently scheduled for tuesdays 2:30-3:20.
however, we may decide to move the time to better fit into
people's schedules. 

visits to the meany middle school and the washington middle school
may be scheduled, depending on the interests of the participating
students.

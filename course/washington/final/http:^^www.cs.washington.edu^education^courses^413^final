 number of credits:

 grading:
 homework 20%
 midterm exam  25%
 final exam 35%
 project 15%
 class participation 5%

 hardcopy readings:
 text (selected sections).
many of the readings for the course will be online, but the first set of
readings is part of my recent book on lisp and artificial intelligence.
there will be several readings from the book throughout the course,
including readings on lisp, logic programming and prolog, grammars and
parsing, language understanding systems, and shells for expert systems.
you can either purchase the whole book at the bookstore (approximately
15 copies have been ordered) or do a combination of getting copies from
the copy center and reading in the library.  the book is entitled,
the elements of artificial intelligence using common lisp, 2nd edition,
w. h. freeman, 1995.  chapter 2 (introduction to programming in
common lisp) and the lisp glossary may be purchased
separately at the copy center in the basement of the communications building.



 online reference materials for lisp:
 what lisp is.
 
the lisp faq provides the answers to many questions about lisp and
its implementations.
 
common lisp: the language, 2nd edition is the standard reference
on common lisp. (it seems best if you access it via the table-of-contents
page, rather than by trying to download the entire html file or
postscript.)

 you can get the source code for 
the lisp programs from the elements of artificial intelligence using
common lisp, 2nd edition.
 the web site for
digitool, inc., the company that
maintains and supports macintosh common lisp, provides the most current
information about mcl.
 here are some interesting links to info about how to use lisp for
 programming world-wide web applications.



 online reference materials for c.
 introduction
to c programming is an online tutorial.
 programming in c is another online tutorial, but it's on a website in the uk that
doesn't always respond promptly.
 these are two of the several tutorials that are listed
 here.

 online reference materials for java.
 
the java language trail map.

 january 2.
 welcome to this course and its course web!
this course is about programming languages and their implementation.
in some of the department's listings, it is called "languages and compilers,"
although in the catalog it is called "programming languages and their
implementation."
it covers interpreters, compilers, and other techniques for building
programming systems.  our attention will focus mainly on two particular programming
languages: lisp and c.  with lisp, we will explore many issues relevant to
intepreted languages, while with c, we will investigate compilers.
in addition to traditional language issues and techniques, we will also
look into current issues such as visual programming systems and programming
facilities for the world-wide web.

 january 2.
 facilities:
this quarter, cse 413 students will have the use of both the mscc macintoshes
(running macintosh common lisp 3.0) and the mscc unix systems.
mscc is the
mathematical sciences computing center.  the mscc macs are located in the
basement of thompson hall.  some of the macs are in room 3 and some in room 9.
while the macs offer mcl (and a variety of other languages such as mathematica)
the mscc unix hosts offer, c, lex, yacc, allegro
common lisp, and other software facilities.

macintosh common lisp provides a particularly powerful
environment including full implementation of the common lisp standard,
integrated editor (called fred), and extensive facilities for graphics
and user interface construction.   the macintosh computers are networked,
and files can easily be transferred between them and the unix host machines
of mscc.


  students who have difficulty getting to the macintoshes in
thompson hall can supplement their macintosh work with work on their
own pcs, using such packages as xlisp-stat for windows and micro-emacs.
however, due to our limited ability to support alternative facilities,
students who wish to work on their own pcs will need to access these
resources themselves from archives on the internet.  also, note that
xlisp-stat is a bare-bones implementation of common lisp and does not
have the extensive program-development support that mcl has.
while we are fortunate to have the powerful mcl system for this course,
there is one disadvantage of using it---you must use it in the mscc lab
unless you purchase your own copy of it from
digitool, inc..
(mcl normally costs about $500 a copy, but there is a special student deal
allowing students to purchase it for $135.)
it has been pointed out that there is a free version of allegro common lisp
for windows which can be downloaded from franz.com on the web.
this may be an attractive tool for some students.


 final examination:
 the final exam for cse 413 will be given on monday, march 11,
in sieg 325 from 10:30 to 12:20.  it will be a closed-book test.

 january 4.
 note this: on thursday, january 4, we will meet in
thompson hall room 3, so that we can get introduced to the
laboratory facilities for the course.  so go to thompson this
time, instead of going to our regular classroom.

 january 9.
 this week only ruth's wednesday office hours are moved to thursday 
2:30 - 3:30 in sieg 326a. 

 january 21.
 a beginner's guide to html might be helpful for assignment #3.

 january 22.
 post of the message sent to the class news group regarding
reading files with paths on the mac.

 january 23.
 reminder to please email your assignment #3 to ruth (rea@cs) today, 
even if you turned in a hard copy in class.
click here for info on emailing files from the macs.
 january 29.
 for assignment #4, please turn in a printout of your tokenize program run on several examples.  also please email a copy of tokenize to ruth (rea@cs).

 february 1.
 the midterm examination will be from 10:30-11:50 am on
thursday, february 8.  it will cover these 
topics..
 there will be an optional review session for the midterm exam.
the review session will be held 2:30-3:20 pm on monday, feb. 5, in
sieg hall room 422.  please bring in questions on the material to be
covered.

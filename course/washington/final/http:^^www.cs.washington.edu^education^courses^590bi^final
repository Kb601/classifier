about file formats:  the 
course materials above may be provided in any of several formats:





  html:
    usual web format.  this loads fast and is usually readable,
    but many parts will be generated by automatic translations
    from latex, and the translation may not be very faithful to
    the format of the original.
    





  adobe acrobat  :
    the latest &amp; greatest.
    get a free viewer from adobe's 
    acrobat and the web page.
    
  postscript:
    the 
    ghostscript home page
    has free viewers (mac, windows, os/2, linux, ...)
  
at this time, acrobat is supported on fewer systems, but is
preferable if you can use it -- files are smaller, rendering is
faster and more legible, and it can print (which mac ghostscript
can't, for example).

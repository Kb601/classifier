possible.

   final exam: i have been told that it is on monday,  march 11 - 
i should probably verify the time.  the exam will be a two hour, closed book,
in class exam that covers all of the material from the class.  the exam will
consist of short answer and problem solving questions.


bureaucratic stuff


grading  based upon homework, exams, project and class participation.



working together on homework  it is okay to discuss homework
problems with your classmates, but  you must write your solutions up
independently.  (the gilligan's island rule could be invoked: between
any discussion of the homework, and writing up a solution, you must
watch at least half an hour of gilligan's island.  the theory is that
an episode of gilligan is equivalent to a reboot, so anything that
survives was learned and understood.)

mathematical programming, machine learning, and parallel computing




 research summary 

optimization theory is rich mathematically while being very effective
computationally in solving many real-life problems. my interests
in this topic have ranged over a broad spectrum that encompasses
theoretical aspects, such as error bounds for mathematical programs
and variational inequalities, convergence proofs for parallel
gradient and variable distribution algorithms for optimization,
smoothing techniques for solving constrained optimization problems
as differentiable nonlinear equations, as well as applications
to machine learning, both in general and specific contexts. an
important aspect of my research is the use of mathematical programming
techniques in diagnosing breast cancer, that has resulted in a
highly accurate computerized diagnostic system in current use
at university of wisconsin hospitals.

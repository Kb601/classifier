my research centers around programming languages (in particular, object-oriented
languages) and their efficient implementation. in my previous life at stanford,
i developed an optimizing compiler for the pure object-oriented language
self which removed a large part of the
overhead traditionally associated with message passing. the resulting self
system outperforms comparable systems (such as commercial smalltalk implementations)
by a factor of two to three on some medium-sized (500-line) benchmarks.


a second aspect of that project was to integrate optimizing compilation
into an interactive programming environment by developing techniques to
avoid long compilation pauses and to allow source-level debugging of optimized
code. 


i'm interested in many aspects of language implementation, such as 


compiler optimizations to eliminate message sends (profile-based compiler
optimizations, type inference, etc.), 

efficient dispatch techniques for statically- and dynamically-typed
languages, 

compiler support for garbage collection (&quot;garbage prevention is
better than garbage collection&quot;), 

measurements and analyses of the execution characteristics of (optimized)
object-oriented programs, for example, their instruction mix, cache performance
etc., and 

software engineering related aspects of object-oriented programming,
such as profilers and debuggers for oo programs. 


current projects include optimizing compilers or runtime systems for
self, c++, and java. check out the publications
page if you're interested in more details. some of my research results
have recently been incorporated into animorphic
systems' smalltalk and java virtual machines.

(if my name displays as &quot;h lzle&quot; on your screen,
then your program can't display that funny &quot;o&quot; with the two dots
on top. changing the font usually helps; e.g., on my system, times regular
doesn't work but times small or new century schoolbook do. the correct
ascii way to spell my name is &quot;hoelzle&quot; -- in german, the &quot;o
with umlaut&quot; expands into &quot;oe&quot;; but often, people also spell
it as &quot;holzle. it's pronounced like this.)

   research interests   

robotics and artificial intelligence
with emphasis on designing algorithms, analysis tools, and 
environments to support the solution of complex high-dimensional
problems governed by physical laws.  

applications in  molecular biology (computer-aided
pharmaceutical drug design), and medicine (robot-assisted surgery). 




  teaching  

spring 1997:  algorithmic robotics

bernard moret



professor bernard m.e. moret was born in
switzerland,
where he spent his first twenty years.




in memoriam:  my good friend and climbing partner jane
tennessen died sunday, june 23, when climbing with two other common friends
in the sandias.  jane was 34 years old, a licensed clinical psychologist,
the clinical director of the santa fe rape crisis center, and a wonderful
friend -- happy, helpful, and loved climbing.
i have a small tribute to her, along with a pictorial.
she died through human error, not her own -- her only error was to trust too
much in another climber, who took her (experienced and technically sophisticated
at sports climbing, but completely inexperienced on natural routes) and
a novice climber on a serious (5.9+), 8-pitch route with thin protection.
the anchors at a belay station pulled and all three fell to their death.
i mourn her loss.



education and experience

baccalauréat degrees in latin, greek, and mathematics
diploma of electrical engineering from the swiss federal institute of technology
    (ecole polytechnique fédérale) of lausanne
software and firmware engineer for omega electronic in bienne for 2 years
ms and phd in electrical engineering from the
   university of tennessee
on the faculty of the department of computer science since 1980
    (chairman from 1991 until 1993)



research interests

pattern recognition
complexity theory
algorithmic paradigms
computational geometry
the empirical assessment of algorithms and data structures
applications of the above to practical problems, especially 3d simulation

he has published over 30 papers in these areas and co-authored (with henry shapiro)
a graduate text on algorithms; a list of publications
(and postscript versions of some of them) is available.  he is the editor-in-chief of
the acm journal of experimental algorithmics.


teaching
in the department, he teaches courses in algorithms and data structures,
in computational geometry, in parallel algorithms, in complexity theory,
in computability theory, and in pattern recognition.

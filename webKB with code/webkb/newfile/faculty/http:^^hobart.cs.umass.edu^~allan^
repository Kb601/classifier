i am a research assistant professor working with the center for intelligent information
retrieval (ciir).  my current work focuses on these areas:

   tools for browsing collections of documents

   relevance feedback techniques

   combining structural information about documents with textual
  information in order to improve quality of retrieval.  this is joint
  work with daniela
  rus at the dartmouth
  college's department of computer science.

a list of my papers, including on-line copies of many of them, is
available here.


 i got the ph.d. in january, 1995, from cornell university's computer science department.  my
advisor was the late gerard
salton (1927-1995).  my thesis was on the automatic construction
of hypertext links.

 i am guest co-editor of a special topic issue of information
processing and management on the tools for the automatic
construction of hypertext and hypermedia.  for more details, see the
call for papers.


on an on-going basis, i am running a research group meeting called
topics in information retrieval.  it is
also a seminar which students can take.


in the old days, i played ice
hockey with cornell's cs department.

 at cornell, i worked with the smart system information retrieval
group.  i also participated in discussions with the information
capture and access research group.

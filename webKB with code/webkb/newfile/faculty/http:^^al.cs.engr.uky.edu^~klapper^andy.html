 my hobbies include  
  morris dancing and  
  bird watching.  sometimes i do both at the same time, but usually the
  other dancers get upset when i run into them. 
 my overall research interest is in applying algebra and number theory to
  problems in cryptography and communications.  my current research projects
  involve  2-adic shift
  registers,  sequences
  for cdma systems, and  multicovering radii of
  codes  

 available papers.

 i am currently teaching  cs 685  
     error correcting codes.

you are reviewing a paper, i wrote a page

political

if you oppose trivial software patents and the barriers they raise
to entry into the software market, you should join
the league for programming freedom,
as i have.





for more information about the communications decency act (currently
struck down by a lower court, a status which is being appealed to the
supreme court by the justice department), a heinous assault on your
freedom of speech, see what the organizations that support your
electronic freedom have to say: the center for democracy and
technology, the electronic frontier
foundation, and the electronic privacy
information center.  

my pgp public key.



artistic

automotive

 our ocularly dominant
automobile, shown here behind harvard's william james hall in the final
stages of painting, is part of  jim
muller's art car caravan. the central portion of the hood is
copied from nobel laureates hubel and weisel's influential work on
occular dominance columns in cat striate cortex.

this lovely art car is in new jersey.  it costs $300 to import a
car into california, so our creation is for sale.
ya wanna buy?  talk
to me, baby.


ceramic

my ceramic art combines wheel thrown techniques and hand building to
play at the ago old tension in pottery between doing something and
saying something.

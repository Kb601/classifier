research interests
keith cooper's research interests include compilation for modern 
microprocessors, classical code optimization, and 
interprocedural analysis and optimization.
he is project director of the massively
scalar compiler project at rice. 

in an earlier life, he was one of the principal designers and
implementors of the rn and parascope programming environments for 
fortran.  these systems served as a testbed for research in various 
compilation issues for scalar and parallel machines.  the current 

d system project is a descendant of those early systems.

 papers and 
 code.

areas of interest

automatic theorem proving and artificial intelligence 


summary of research


my research focuses on automated theorem proving and automatic theorem
proof checking. this involves the use of heuristics and higher level
plans, as well as the use of examples and of analogy. i am also
interested in research on analogy and learning in artificial
intelligence.

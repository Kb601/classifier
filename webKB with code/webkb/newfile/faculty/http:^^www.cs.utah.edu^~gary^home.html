gary lindstrom





professor of computer 
science






gary lindstrom is a graduate of carnegie-mellon university, where he earned
b.s. and m.s. degrees in mathematics, and a ph.d. in computer science.  he
is currently professor of computer science at the university of utah, having
taught previously at the university of pittsburgh.  among dr. lindstrom's
research interests are programming language design, specification and
implementation, with special emphasis on the programming aspects of parallel
and distributed systems.
he has served as an ieee computer society distinguished
visitor, and has been awarded the university of utah college of
engineering outstanding teaching award.  dr. lindstrom recently
retired as editor in chief of
the  
international journal of parallel programming, and co-edited the
book  logic programming: functions, relations and equations.  his
research has been supported by nsf, arpa, onr, and industrial sponsors
mcc, ibm, xerox, ncr and l. m. ericsson.
he served on the nsf computer and computation
research advisory committee from 1988 to 1992, and as a 
consultant to the united nations development programme in 1988.
dr. lindstrom is chair of the
organick 
memorial lecture series.





current research projects:

persistent object stores:
the
mach shared objects
project is building an
object manager (om) layered on modern operating systems.  our om is
based on system server concepts, presenting a standardized
interface to c++ and common lisp (cl) programs.  the mso approach to
persistence emphasizes (i) generality of source language support, (ii)
portability and heterogeneity, (iii) data evolution, (iv) distributed
implementation and access, and (v) the representation of software
components as objects managed through a pervasive system service. 


module manipulation tools: the fast and flexible mach-based
systems project seeks to develop an operating system that provides a much
higher degree of flexibility than do traditional systems, and to use that
added flexibility to circumvent the performance/functionality tradeoffs that
thwart traditional highly-decomposed, microkernel-based operating systems.
foundations for this work include (i) a comprehensive notion of modules, (ii)
module manipulation cast as a system service, and (iii) a semantically
enriched notion of module compatibility and adaptability.  items (i) and (ii)
arose from the mach shared objects project (see above), while (iii) is a new
emphasis motivated by pragmatically important inter-module concerns such as
address space sharing, storage management policies, and levels of trust.


software for human genetics applications:
in collaboration with the

utah center for human genome research,
software is being developed to aid in genetic
applications such as linkage analysis, genetic and physical mapping, and
large scale genetic sequencing.
key aspects include (i) data modeling using relational and object-oriented
database management systems, (ii) sequencing production workflow simulation,
planning and real-time control, and (iii) automated inspection, monitoring,
and robotic manipulation of biochemical laboratory processes.
the educational dimension of this collaboration centers on an
interdisciplinary program in 
genome science.

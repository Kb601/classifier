prof. goodrich's research is directed at the design of high
performance methods for solving geometric and combinatoric problems
that are motivated from computer vision, computer graphics, astronomy,
computer-aided design, and scientific data analysis.
he is co-director of the 
center 
for geometric computing at johns
hopkins university, which is part of a larger collaborative center at
brown, duke and johns hopkins, and is supported by the army research
office.



prof. goodrich has served on the program committee for several
respected conferences in computational geometry and theoretical
computer science, including
acting as chair for 26th acm symp.on theory of computing (stoc).  he
is an associate editor for 
international journal of computational geometry & applications,
journal of computer and system sciences,
journal of graph algorithms and applications,
and
information processing letters.  
he has been awarded
several oraculum awards for excellence in teaching.

research areas

i am interested in building systems that can act intelligently in the real
world. to this end, i work on a broad spectrum of topics in ai. these can
be grouped under the following headings:


 formal foundations: provably intelligent systems
 machine learning: including adaptive probabilistic networks
 real-time decision making 
 decision making under uncertainty: including the batmobile project


i also work on the roadwatch project with 
jitendra malik,
funded by caltrans and jpl, which will ``provide real-time,
intelligent traffic surveillance for the nation's freeways and cities.''

 netsurfers are encouraged to jump to my
hotlist.





my "real" position is professor of computer science at

fordham university
(fordham college at lincoln center, to be precise).
i have been a visiting scholar in the 

columbia university computer science department 
since 1982.



i do work in 
information-based complexity.
my special interests include the following:


 complexity of partial differential equations.
 complexity of integral equations.
 complexity of ill-posed problems.


here are some recent papers.



  
  the complexity of definite elliptic problems with noisy data
  


  
  the complexity of the poisson problem for spaces of bounded mixed derivatives
  


  
  what is the complexity of solution-restricted operator equations?
  


  
  the complexity of multivariate elliptic problems with analytic data
  



i also maintain
cac-net/focm-net,
an electronic conferencing system for researchers in continuous algorithms and
complexity and in foundations of computational mathematics.

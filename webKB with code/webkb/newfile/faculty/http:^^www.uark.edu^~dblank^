teaching


this semester i am teaching programming
i (c++) and advanced
programming languages.





interests

 i am generally interested in artificial intelligence,
cognitive science, and machine learning. specifically, i am interested
in teaching artificial neural networks (aka, connectionist networks)
how to perform high-level cognitive tasks such as analogy-making. i
plan on forming an artificial intelligence lab here at the university
of arkansas where we will study robots, machine learning, neural
networks, and other forms of artificial intelligence. the emphasis
will be on systems capabable of learning high-level cognitive
abilities starting with nothing but low-level perceptions. i have also
been working on organizing a cognitive science program here as
well.

if you have ideas, comments,
or questions, feel free to drop
me a line.





publications


behavior-based analogy-making proceedings
of the cognitive science society, 1996 (postscript)


a short description of a neural network that makes analogies. 


implicit analogy-making: a connectionist
exploration midwest 
ai &amp; cs, 1996 (html)


reports on three experiments done with the neural network analogy-making
program introduced in the above cogsci report.


a distributed
representation of multiple objects in a visual scene. (postscript 183k)


examination of a novel method of representing objects without resorting
to named roles and relations. midwest artificial intelligence and cognitive
science conference proceedings (blank, 1995).


grounding
via scanning: cooking up roles from scratch. (postscript 112k)


a look at a connectionist model that develops without the knead for
named roles and fillers. midwest artificial intelligence and cognitive
science conference proceedings (blank, 1992).


exploring
the symbolic/subsymbolic continuum: a case study of raam. (postscript
476k)


an in-depth look at the mechanics of recursive auto-associative memory,
or raam. discusses how this connectionist model fits into the symbolic
and subsymbolic paradigms (blank, meeden, and marshall, 1992).


emergent
control and planning in an autonomous vehicle. (postscript 247k)


proceedings of the 15th annual cognitive science conference (meeden,
mcgraw, blank, 1993).






projects


starting a cognitive science program at uark.
con-x: connectionist
programming language,tcl/tk graphics programs, and associated support tools.

psychological experimenter's toolbox: sperling's whole, partial, and
word superiority experiments. a dos program for dos, win3.1, win95, winnt.
the program, and
a users guide.


starting a robotics and perceptual processing laboratory at uark.


the robot is on order: expected shipping date 11/01/96

see robot run. see robot see. see
it yourself. (ours is red, of course).


pioneer i

fast-track vision expansion system

pair of radio modems


name the robot! razorbot?! send me your suggestions.







thesis


i am currently finishing my thesis, learning
to see analogies: a connectionist account, at indiana university under
the direction of michael
gasser.





family

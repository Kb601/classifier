i'm the associate chair of the university of florida's

computer &amp; information science &amp; engineering department.
i received my ph.d. in computer science from the
university of virginia
department of computer science in 1985.


my interests lie in programming languages, computer vision,
and the boundary where these two areas of study meet.


  
  
   image algebra
   nowadays i'm most closely associated with the image algebra project.
       the goal of this project is the development of a formal mathematical
       notation well-suited to the expression of image-processing and
       computer-vision algorithms.  this has led to numerous mathematical
       results as well as the development of the image algebra c++ class
       library (iac++).
       
       gerhard ritter and i
       have written the handbook of computer
       vision algorithms in image algebra. it is in
       publication with crc press.
       it contains a brief introduction to image algebra and
       shows how it can be applied by specifying over 80 computer
       vision and image processing algorithms.

       
       
   administrivia
   i have a small collection of cis department and university of
       florida administrative information.
       
   marlais dylan interpreter
   i maintain the marlais interpreter.
       this is a freely available interpreter for a language approximating
       apple computer's dynamic object-oriented programming language
       dylan.
       
   image algebra course
   during the fall semester of 1996, i am teaching a course on
       image algebra (cap 6418 sec. 4694x).

   object-oriented programming
   during the spring semester of 1996, i am teaching an object-oriented
       programming (cis 4930 sec. 0998x).
       
   facilities and equipment committee
   i maintain some information about the department facilities and
       equipment committee.
       
   1994-95 tip award portfolio
   
       i was selected for a 1994-95 tip award.  my application portfolio is
       available for browsing.
       
   old image algebra course
   during the spring semester of 1995 i taught a course
       on image algebra (cis 6930 section 0942v).
       
   old oop course info
   during the spring semester of 1995, i taught an object-oriented
       programming (cis 4930 sec. 0939x).
       
   computers & vision
   during the fall semester of 1994 i taught
       computers and vision (cap 6416).

research summary

my research focuses on developing and testing theories of how people
acquire and process language.  my approach is to analyze language
acquisition and language processing tasks as problems in reasoning
under uncertainty.  to carry out such an analysis for a particular
linguistic task, one must:


make a hypothesis about the sources of information people use to perform
the task.

work out a formula for the way in which information of this type
affects the probabilities of various linguistic analyses, according to
normative rules of conditional probability.  this yields a
mathematical hypothesis at marr's computational level about the
implications of the information source for the linguistic task.

develop an algorithm by which the language processor could evaluate
various linguistic analyses, according to the formula.  this requires
specifying how the language processor determines which analyses to
evaluate, since there are typically far too many to evaluate all of
them.

using computer simulation, investigate the extent which the algorithm
can perform the task. 

if the simulations show that the algorithm is effective, use the
evaluation formula to make predictions about human behavior and test
them by psycholinguistic methods.


so far, my collaborators and i have applied this method to:


segmentation and word discovery by young children ( short abstract format )

the discovery of syntactic substitution classes by young children
( short abstract html format )

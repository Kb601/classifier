pithy quotes:

&quot;laziness in doing stupid things can be a great virtue&quot; --
james hilton, lost horizon

&quot;sometimes we are confronted with more data than we can really
use, and it may be wisest to forget and to destroy most of it&quot; --
donald knuth, the art of computer programming

&quot;concepts are delicious snacks with which we try to alleviate our
amazement&quot; -- a. j. heschel, man is not alone

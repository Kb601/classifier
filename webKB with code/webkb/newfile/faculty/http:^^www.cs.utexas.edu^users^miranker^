 daniel miranker's 
 belated web presence 

(under construction, see something you'd like finished, don't hold your breath,
just send me a note, miranker@cs.utexas.edu, i'll get it to you the old fashion
way.  my students pages wouldn't be a bad place to go either.}


 on rule matching   

if you are here to learn more about the treat algorithm and its
comparison to rete, be warned that both have been rendered obsolete by
the  leaps  algorithm.

 current research interests 

my current research goals encompass the venus rule language, its use
as the basis of active, distributed databases and the fundamental
computer science problems and corollaries that have evolved from that
goal.

 (csp) constraint satisfaction search

 query optimization, both relational and 
object-oriented.

 parallel execution of rule-based programs

 knowledge compilation 

 bibliographies, sometimes linked to papers (coming soon)

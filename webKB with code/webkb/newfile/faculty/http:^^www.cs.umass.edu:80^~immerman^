neil immerman



neil immerman (professor) received b.s. and m.s. degrees in mathematics
from yale university in 1974 and his ph.d. from cornell university in 1980.
he taught in the computer science departments at tufts university and yale
university before joining the department in 1989. professor immerman is one
of the key developers of an active research program called descriptive
complexity.  using this approach, he has settled a number of open
questions in both computational
complexity theory and database theory.  professor immerman is an editor
of information and computation, the chicago journal of theoretical computer
science, and the journal of symbolic logic.  he is the winner, jointly with
r&#243;bert szelepcs&#233;nyi, of the 1995 g&#246;del prize in theoretical
computer science.

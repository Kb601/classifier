research interests

my research interests include distributed computing, fault-tolerance
and real-time.  i work on methodologies, paradigms, and algorithms for
fault-tolerant distributed systems, in both message-passing and
shared-memory  systems.  my long-term goal is to bridge the gap
between  theoretical results and the need for efficient and practical
solutions.

in collaboration with
tushar chandra
and 
prasad jayanti, 
two ph.d.
computer science students, we continued our work on
unreliable failure
detectors for message-passing systems,
and on wait-free objects for shared-memory systems.

a fundamental result of fault-tolerant distributed computing
states that the consensus problem cannot be solved (with a
deterministic  algorithm) in asynchronous systems.  this impossibility
result  is due to the inherent difficulty of determining whether a
process  has crashed (or is merely very slow) in such a system.  in
our work,  we were able to determine exactly how much information
about  failures is necessary and sufficient to solve consensus.  we
first  showed one can use w, an unreliable failure detector that can
make an  infinite number of mistakes, to solve consensus in systems
with a  majority of correct processes.  we then proved that to solve
consensus, any failure detector has to provide at least as much
information about  failures as w.  thus, w is the weakest failure
detector for solving  consensus in asynchronous systems with a
majority of correct  processes.  we are now exploring the practicality
of  implementing w,  and of applications that rely on w for their
correctness.

a concurrent system consists of processes communicating via shared
objects.   a shared object is wait-free if each process that accesses
this  object is guaranteed to get a response even if all the other
processes  crash.  we are now exploring wait-free hierarchies of
object types, where each object (type) is assigned to a level that
corresponds to its  ability in implementing other wait-free objects.
in particular,  prasad jayanti has shown that a well-known hierarchy
(herlihy's)  is not robust:  informally, in this hierarchy there is an
object at level  2 that can be used to implement wait-free objects at
any  level.  we  are now exploring the question of whether
robust wait-free hierarchies exist.

image motion analysis for character animation control

our research is motivated by the problem of teaching
a graphical model to perform a realistic motion.  this problem has
its roots in the art of cartoon animation and has modern applications to
computer animation, virtual reality, teleconferencing, and robotics.
the task is to endow a graphical model with the knowledge of how to perform
a repertoire of interesting motions.  once learned, these motions can be
invoked directly via high-level cues (e.g. "smile", "walk"), inferred via an
abstract goal (e.g. "go to the store"), or cued off of low-level
events from a virtual input device or an image sequence.  

other projects include the analysis of 
 periodic motion 
and tracking of rigid and nonrigid objects.

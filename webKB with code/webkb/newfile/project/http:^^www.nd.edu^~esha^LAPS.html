laboratory for advanced parallel systems in nd, laps  



 



(this page is under construction) 
 the laboratory for advanced parallel systems (laps)  is studying
all aspects of architectural and system issues 
of advanced high-performance parallel architectures.
for example, one focus of laps is studying and designing new generations 
of scalable massive parallel architectures based on 
the expereince of a working massive parallel machine, execube, which  
was designed by dr. kogge.
another focus of laps lead by
dr. sha is developing parallelization techniques which can
optimally utilize processors, communications and memory.
more detailed descriptions of research projects can be found in this
page.

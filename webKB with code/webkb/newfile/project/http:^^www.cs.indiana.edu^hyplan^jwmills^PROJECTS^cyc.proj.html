indiana university cyclotron controller


description: 

this joint project with the indiana university cyclotron facility applies analog field computers as real-time controllers for the dipole and quadrupole electromagnets in the iucf beam line. simplicity, adjustability, and rapid response to changing conditions are achieved with a digitally-reconfigurable vlsi field computer that has an analog computation path, and includes an integrated simulator to compute beam moments from non-invasive beam position monitors. the prototype controller is a 2mm x 2mm mosis "tinychip".

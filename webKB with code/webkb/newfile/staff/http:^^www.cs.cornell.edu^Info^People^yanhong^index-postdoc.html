yanhong annie liu 


 i am a post-doctorate associate working with professor  tim teitelbaum.

research interests 

general systematic approaches to improving the efficiency of
computations.  program analysis and transformation techniques for
incremental computation and parallel/concurrent computation.
applications in optimizing compilers, language-based interactive
systems, algorithm design, program development, software system
organization, and software maintenance.

 research 


    
    i am interested in the problem of safety-critical
    software.  we are all aware of devices, systems, and
    structures that can cause catastrophes when they fail.  as
    computer hardware becomes less expensive and as more expectations
    are placed on software, computers are being placed in control of a
    wider range of these applications.  software has advantages over
    conventional technologies, e.g., flexibility.  
    but these advantages come at a price.  software behavior can be
    very complex and unpredictable.  perhaps the best publicized example is
    the three mile island incident, in which operators had great
    difficulty in diagnosing the state of the system during an emergency.


    the requirements stage of software development is key to a project's
    success, especially with respect to safety.  for that reason, 
    my colleagues and i have concentrated on requirements, especially
    the communication of requirements via a requirements specification.
    to that end we have developed a state-based language called
    
    requirements state machine language, or rsml.
    we have validated the usefulness of this language by
    specifying tcas ii, 
    an avionics system.


    for my doctoral thesis i invented a hazard analysis procedure
    based on the hazard and operability (hazop) study.

    the most significant concept that this new procedure borrows from
    hazop is that of a deviation, hence the name deviation
    analysis.  see below for a link to an html transcription of
    the dissertation.



 current projects 


 deviation analysis
     
      write conference article summarizing deviation analysis.
      make deviation analysis software available to uw safety-critical 
          software group.
      study the possibility of dynamic display and control of 
          deviation analysis searches.  (with siang lin loo)
     
 rsml tool set
     
      integrate deviation analysis software with rsml tool set.  
          (with kurt partridge)
      make alpha version of rsml tool set publicly available. 
          (with kurt partridge and sean sandys)
     
 rsml semantics
      
      draft semantics document, including discussion of rsml variants
      develop example of improved semantics

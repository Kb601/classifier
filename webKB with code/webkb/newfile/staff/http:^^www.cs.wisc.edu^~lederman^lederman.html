 my research interests include:



 my research at the univ. of wisconsin at madison relates to the
wisconsin wind tunnel project.

 my other big research area is parallel linear algebra which is
covered by the prism
project.

 i am also heavily involed in the  mpi
standard.

i and several others recently published a book about the original mpi
standard.  you can get information on ordering the book from  mit press (isbn
95-80471).  you can also look at mpi:
the complete reference on the web.

as the mpi-2 editor, i can get you the current draft of the mpi forum.
please keep in mind that the work of the mpi forum is ongoing and
its documents are intended for use by those interested in the ongoing
work of the mpi forum. for committee members, the 
compressed postscript, complete sources as a  compressed
tar file, and the 
individual source files are available.



 information you would get if you did a finger on me:

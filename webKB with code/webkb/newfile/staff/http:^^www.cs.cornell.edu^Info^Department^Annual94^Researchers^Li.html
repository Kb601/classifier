my general research interests are in numerical optimization and scientific computation.  i am also interested in applying optimization techniques to solve real world engineering problems.

my current interests include generalizing the trust region theory for unconstrained minimization to nonlinearly constrained minimization.  in particular, for nonlinearly constrained problems, there do not exist acceptance conditions for optimality.  i have been investigating a new affine scaling trust region method for minimizing a nonlinear i (sub-1) function; including a trust region convergence analysis.  the method can be used to solve a general nonlinearly constrained minimization problem using an exact penalty approach.  an application of the new method has been considered for image enhancement problems.

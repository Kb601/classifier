      cs 490/ma 485: theory of computation 
      fall 1996
      
      
       the theory of computation investigates the nature of
      computation, apart from any particular computing devices or
      programming languages.  it develops mathematical models of
      computation and uses these to investigate and characterize the
      inherent limitations of computing.

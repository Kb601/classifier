commercial word processing, operation of commercial software packages, history of computing, sociology of computing, impacts of computers on society.

who should take this course
this course is designed for students who have little or no experience in computer science and who want a general overview of the field.  little or no mathematical background is required.  
however, students should be prepared for a rigorous coverage of computing including extensive programming, detailed studies of the internals of the computer, and various advanced topics.  
students should be prepared to learn several mathematial notations in the course and to use them extensively.



announcements

this is kind of an informal section on the web page where i (eric) will 
try to post class gossip and info about what's going on.


click for old news



anyone who scored 80 or higher on the midterm is exempt from the lab
final.  however, you can still take it if you wish to use it to raise your
grade.  the lab final will probably be the week after thanksgiving but
that's just my best guess--i haven't discussed it with dr. biermann
yet. 



the final exam for this class is on wednesday, 18 december from 7 to 10 
pm.  here's the whole schedule.



we've decided that the t-f question on the quiz about right-clicking to 
download an image was poorly worded. if you lost half a point on this 
question, bring your quiz by my office in d328 (or slip it under the door) 
and i'll fix your grade.  -steve



it's about time to be registering for classes for spring... if anyone is 
interested in taking more cps classes or in becoming a cps major and 
would like to talk to a fellow undergrad who has taken all the classes 
and is a major... send me mail or 
talk to me in lab or after class.



grading
approximate weights

programs, problems
    20%

programming test (aka lab final, in labs)
    10%

quizzes (every week after wednesday lecture)
    25%

midterm exam (wednesday, 16 october)
    20%

final exam (as indicated on official schedule)
    25%



policies
each student must write his or her own programs without help from other persons.  after a program is typed into a machine, students may help each other to find bugs but not to write new code.  
homework problems must be done without help from others.
    no make-up exams will be given.  if an exam is missed for reasons beyond the student's control, a written excuse should be handed in.  the final grade will be based on the other scores earned.
    the lowest two quizzes will not be counted.  no make-up quizzes will be given.  if a quiz is missed for an excusable reason, be sure to hand in a written excuse.  the quiz average will be based on the quizzes actually taken.
    late homeworks, programs, or labs will receive 80% of full credit if they are handed in within seven days o the regular due date.  after seven days, no credit will be given except in unusual circumstances.
    the grade of i (incomplete) will be administered as specified by university rules.  thus it will be not given to those students who simply did not complete the course on time.
    unethical practices by any student (such as copying on an exam or homework) will be dealt with strictly, usually by turning the case over to the judicial board. 
(special caution: often two or more versions of the quizzes or exams are given on a given day.  thus your neighbor may be taking a different test from you.)
    the final exam is not optional and every student will be required to take it at the scheduled time unless a written excuse from the dean is presented.
    students who receive 85% or higher on the midterm exam may skip the lab final programming test.  their final grades will be based upon their average in other parts of the course.
    final grades will be assigned approximately on the basis of 90%-100% a, 80%-89% b, and so forth.



schedule
this schedule will be projected to the end of the term soon.  if you click on the topic for a day you will see a handout for that day.  note that the handout for 9/4 is this document; clicking on it will take you back to the top.

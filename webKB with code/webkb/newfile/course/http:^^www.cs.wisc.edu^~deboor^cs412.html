the text is brand new:  introduction to scientific computing , by c.
van loan (computer science department, cornell university), prentice-hall,
hence there is a growing
 list of errata for the text; also the text
may be supplemented here and there by
additional material  (12sep, 19sep,
24sep, 26sep, 01oct, 08oct, 10oct, 15oct,  17oct, 29oct).

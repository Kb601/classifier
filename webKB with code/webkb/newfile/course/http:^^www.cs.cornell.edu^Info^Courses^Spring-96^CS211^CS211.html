 gofer 

there are there flavors of gofer available.  macgofer is available in
the public labs.

 macgofer 
 pc gofer 
 unix gofer 



the ftp site for gofer is


haskell.systemsz.cs.yale.edu/pub/haskell/gofer 

and the ftp site for macgofer is

 ftp.dcs.gla.ac.uk 
.

please  do not  ftp if you can help it.  if you find a piece of
gofer you think is of general interest, let me know and i'll make it
available from here.  macgofer sources and manuals are available on
the cs department ftp server

 ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/jfoster 
.



 other web servers 



the final project for cs211 is on-line, available on the cs
department's ftp server.

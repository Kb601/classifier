 description: 

modern programming languages, such as sml, java, haskell, and dylan,
provide high-level features such as:

 objects and closures,
 polymorphism, abstract data types, and classes,
 garbage collection,
 exceptions and continuations,
 threads and synchronization constructs.
 
this class will survey modern techniques for efficient implementation
of these features.  our focus will be on the implementation of
modern functional languages, but we will make connections
to other kinds of languages, notably object-oriented.

updates, and other relevant information will be added to this page.

 readings: we require the book by john mccarthy, formalizing
common sense, ablex 1990, which is available at the bookstore.
we have prepared a course
reader which contains other relevant papers in electronic
form.  sections of 
lecture notes from the previous years might also be of interest;
these too are available in electronic form.  mccarthy's home page contains a number of papers on
logical ai, both published and unpublished.

 the papers from the 1996 january symposium on logical
formalizations of commonsense reasoning relate to the subject matter
of this course.  they are accessible from the  formal reasoning group
home page.

b665-6 software engineering management


 syllabus
currently a postscript document containing

 
   general description of the course and the requirements:
   
    class participation, including leading one or two discussions
    literature survey paper
    supervision of p465-6/p565-6 project teams
   

   discussion of team management,
    especially in the context of p465-6/p565-6.

   milestone responsibilities for each of
    the p465 milestones.

   an egregiously out-of-date bibliography
    (think of it as a historical survey).

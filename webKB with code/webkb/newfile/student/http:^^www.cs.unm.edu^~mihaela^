 i'm a phd student in computer science at university of new mexico, albuquerque . my hometown is timisoara, located in the western part of romania. the page about timisoara is rather slow to load, but it has some pictures to help anyone  get a feel about the architecture. and because i was asked often enough, romanians speak a latin-based language, romanian. 

 the major points of my professional trajectory:

 m.d. from the university of medicine and pharmacy of timisoara, romania. 
 development of computational models for the immune system as part of theoretical immunology programs of the santa fe institute and los alamos national laboratory. these programs are directed by alan perelson.
 currently working on my phd, with  stephanie forrest . 


 my research interests revolve around

 theoretical immunology: the focus of the models that i work with is the b cell immune response, both in terms of antibody production and development of memory.
 cognitive science: i am exploring a model of concept acquisition based on  self-organizing maps.
 complex systems

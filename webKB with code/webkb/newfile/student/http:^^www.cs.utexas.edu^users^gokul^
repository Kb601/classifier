gokul's home page



 finally... 

after receiving countless flames and gripes about the
excessive verbosity of my home page, i have decided to bow to the
collective wish of the masses (it's a democratic world) and put
only the barest minimum out here. adieu, my outpourings !
all you critics out there (headed by 
plakal  and hags), i hope
you sleep easy with untroubled consciences after sending a perfectly
 good home page to an untimely demise.
(actually, not quite. for those who want to see what kind 
of web page could merit such vitriol, click 
here  at your own risk.)

maybe your comments can help reinstate my earlier page ! do sign

critical comments, click  here .

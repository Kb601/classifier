  marc shapiro believes, "'a tautology is a tautology' is a tautology."
  
  i am currently obsessively fond of disappear fear, repulsed by c++, 
  pondering fast pointer analyses, watching lots of jackie chan movies, 
  thinking about programming language design, not reading much, trying to
  teach elementary school students to think in terms of recursion,
  and hoping to be interrupted.
  
  this is what c. a. r. hoare wrote about pointers in 1973: "their
  introduction into high-level languages has been a step backward
  from which we may never recover."

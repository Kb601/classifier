michelle is an awesome person.  her page is currently under construction.
my sister kasey has a 
great home page, as does my brother eric.


this semester i'm teaching a couple of sections of cs302.
i'm also working with tom reps in programming languages.  my
exact schedule still needs to be determined.

as an undergrad, i majored in computer science and russian studies
here at the university of wisconsin.  i even spent the fall semester
of '92 in russia.  i don't get a chance to use my russian very often,
and i miss it a bit.  someday, someday, i'll make it back.

my other interests include chess and soccer.  recently, i've been
biking a bit, too.  i've also been distracted from work by numerous
books, and hasty rewrites of my web page.

here are my 
.  i also want to put a link to
mapquest.  i plan on stealing a
lot of their maps in a second to give directions from madison to marshfield.

who is leo selavo anyway ? 
presently i am a graduate student at the department
of computer science at the university
of pittsburgh. 

i am a latvian. born in latvia (you
know, one of those there baltic republics), grown up there, now gone to
the united states to study.

i got my masters degre in computer science at the university
of latvia in 1994. 

i used to work at the university of latvia
as a lecturer. i was instructor for such classes as &quot;human-computer
interaction&quot;, &quot;personal computer organization&quot;
and &quot;seminar on issues on data visualisation&quot;. 

also i used to work at riti, the riga
information technology institute. riti is (was?) a subsidiary of the
sis (swh informative systems) company
in latvia. my work at riti was linked to meta-model based case software
tool development.


brief insight in my interests:



computer architecture, human-computer interaction 

skiing (downhill and xcountry), tennis (court and table) 

hiking, checking out wild nature, like america's national parks (i've
been in about twenty of them). 

photographing, video filming

music: pop/rock, jazz. some of my favourite artists and groups are:
elton john, eric clapton, joe cooker, rod stewart, annie lenox, pink floyd,
ella fitgerald, louis armstrong... 

books, science fiction. my favourite authors are: 


isaac asimov - you can never tell what will happen next. everything
is pretty reasoned. exellent books and storries beside science fiction
as well.

frank herbert - dune chronicles - mix of action, mystery and philosophy.
although not so easy to read, still fascinating.

douglas adams - lot's of fun, original ideas.

andrew norton - great action storry builder.

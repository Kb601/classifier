i am a doctoral candidate 
in the
theory group of the
department of computer science at
the university of massachusetts, 
amherst (aka umass). 
my research interests include
cryptography 
(in particular, the design and analysis of key exchange and authentication 
protocols) and
symbolic computation.

my thesis advisor is
 susan landau.

in may 1993 i received a b.s. with distinction from the
cornell university 
department of computer science, and 
i had the distinct pleasure of visiting the department for the 1995-96
academic year. 

i have a low 
security 
pgp
public key.

as of september 23, 1996 at about 10:35 am est, i looked 
like this 
(400x400 jpeg). my hair is usually much shorter than it appears in this
photo.


 311/611 ta work 
during the fall 1996 semester i'm working as the ta for both cmpsci 311(391) 
and cmpsci 611.

more information. please send course-related email to 
my edlab account,

 secure mobility / mobile security 
this semester i'm taking 
prof. krithi 
ramamritham's seminar on 
mobile computing. alex 
specker and i are concentrating on research issues in mobile security (or,
as i prefer to put it, secure mobility). we are compiling an eternally 
incomplete, partially annotated 

bibliography of references to papers on security in mobile computing 
systems.


 work in symbolic computation 
as part of my qualification for ph.d. candidacy, i completed a
synthesis 
project. my synthesis paper, "typing for interactive symbolic computation" (240k
postscript), explores the relative merits of the data typing schemes in the 
symbolic computation systems
macsyma, 
maple, and 
gap (groups,
algorithms, and programming), and suggests some alternatives.

susan landau and i are collaborating on an efficient implementation in maple 
of the landau/miller `85 polynomial-time decision procedure for determining 
the solvability of a polynomial by radicals.

 other security-related activities
i manage the
 
coderpunks mailing list, where the implementation of strong,
robust, and practical cryptosystems is discussed. 

i am a charter member of the
digital commerce society
of boston, which sponsors a monthly speaking series at the harvard club.
here are bob hettinga's
directions
to the harvard club.
 
 miscellaneous crypto-related writing 

i pointed out some weaknesses of authorization schemes 

based on password encryption with crypt(3)
and

based on pgp signatures
that were proposed for internet domain contact record changes in the
internic

guardian object draft v.1.

 personal links 
i'm also interested in 
some web sites
unrelated to my research.

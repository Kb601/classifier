pente (meaning five) is a board game of skill requiring 2 players. the objective of the game is to get five points or get five of your own pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). points can be earned by trapping the opponents pieces between your pieces. only an even number of pieces can be trapped, i.e. either 2 or 4. for each pair of pieces trapped, you get 1 point. the player reaching five points first wins.

in the paper cited below, we describe attacks by viruses that use the
public key of the virus author. we call such viruses cryptoviruses. we
describe anonymous and secure data stealing attacks, and extortion based
attacks where user data is public key encrypted. since only the attacker 
knows the private key, only the attacker can recover the encrypted data.
hence, we are exploiting the asymmetry of public key cryptography.

countermeasures", proceedings of the 1996 ieee symposium on security and
privacy, pp. 129-140, may 6-8, ieee computer society press, 1996.

we then take cryptovirological attacks a step further and investigate
what can be done by modifying cryptosystems to contain the attackers
public key. in effect we apply "cryptography from within" to
mount attacks that securely and subliminally leak secret key information
to the attacker. pgp can be modified to contain such a mechanism, which
we call a secretly embedded trapdoor with universal protection (setup).

home page for rob conticello





rob conticello fourth year computer science graduate student.  my advisor is panos chrysanthis.

a new more conservative and corporate home page for a new more conservative
me.  there are no bells, whistles, or things that go "bump" in the 'net
on this page, and frankly the only java that i will be seeing for the next few months
is the kind that i internally consume each afternoon.  so stop in and have a
cup, realizing that while i may no longer love you, you're still welcome
nonetheless.


p.s.  if you want to visit my old home page, click here.

welcome to 
jean's homepage. 
i am a ms student in 
computer science department 
at columbia university, 
new york. 
since may 1996, i've been working 
on internet-based client/server projects at 
bell laboratories, 
lucent technologies. 
i am interested in searching, organizing, and finally using the
multimedia data spread over the internet. the project 
webus proposed on september 28, 1996 
is 

vod in the www using rtp and h.263 compression.
we'll see how fast java decoder can run to suffice our goal, real-time
video on-demand service over the internet. 



always under constructions.

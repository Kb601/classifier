 systems building experience 

 multi-agent systems 

worked with a multi-agent design system called team for creating steam
condenser designs. extended the team system to enable learning
organizational knowledge. also worked with a simulator called taems
for modeling and studying coordination issues in multi-agent
system. extended this system to enable it to learn coordination. in
addition, conceived, designed and built a system for distributed
case-based reasoning. (common lisp/clos).



 networked information gathering  

worked on a team building an agent-based networked information
gathering system. was resposible for the planner component and the
integration of all the system components. (common lisp/c)



 machine learning systems  

built a number of machine learning systems in both lisp and
c. programmed id3, ibl, and cbr systems, wrote code for genetic
algorithms and designed and built a flexible neural networks simulator
in c. (lisp/ c).



 pattern recognition systems  

project leader for a team that built
a handwritten numerals recognition system for automated bank check
processing. was actively involved in building various components in
addition to managing the team.



 information retrieval  

built a complete ir system as a part of information retrieval
course. the system creates inverted indices, retrieves and ranks
documents and displays them to the user. (c).



 expert systems  

built an expert system for psychiatric evaluation using the vp expert
shell (200 rules).


 information extraction and natural language processing 

built a small ie system for the ``terrorist events'' domain using
methods for statistical nlp for information extraction.



 compilers & os  

implemented a complete two-pass compiler for a considerable subset of
modula to generate assembly code for mips r3000 architecture. this
includes developing a scanner, parser, semantic processing and
assembly language code generation.  also wrote code for device drivers
and a shell.

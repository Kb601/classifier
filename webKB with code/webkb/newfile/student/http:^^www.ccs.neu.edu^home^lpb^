i'm a graduate student in the 
northeastern university college of computer science.

finger me to see what's up. 

i am maintaining the muddex
for people who are interested in the history and future of multi-user
internet games.

here are some obligatory cool links
to play with when you should be working.

here are some things that have nothing to do with computers:

jewelry.

an anti-valentine.

here is an actual excerpt from a paper i wrote for a religions of
china class at wesleyan university in spring of 1989 on buddhism.  don't take it too
seriously.

a short essay on relationships.  and c.
written in early 1993 when things weren't going so well.  includes
numerous obscenities. 

have some quotes.  what corner
of cyberspace is complete without them?

on wednesday, april 13, i will be installing the tattoo i've been
meaning to get for a year.  click to see the original art.  here is a somewhat
blury photo taken in the pit at cullinane of the tattoo itself the day after.  note
that it's reversed left-to-right from the original.  here's a somewhat
disjointed account of the experience.

a poem.

just to be heretical, an apocryphon.

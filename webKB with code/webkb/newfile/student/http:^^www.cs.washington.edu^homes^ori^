hi,



i'm a second year graduate student at the university of
washington.  

before moving to seattle, i lived in california for seven years:  four
years at berkeley and three years in lancaster (northeast of los angeles).
i am originally from israel, where i lived at haifa, bat-yam and holon.
for fun i like to practice tae kwon do, play basketball, and go hiking.



this quarter i'm taking one class, a whole bunch of seminars, and am
taing 
cse378 -- computer architecture.  you can usually find me at my office
(233 sieg) when i'm not in class.  my office hours for cse378 are
monday 1:30-2:20 and wednesday 3:30-4:20.



potential employers are welcome to look at my 
 resume .

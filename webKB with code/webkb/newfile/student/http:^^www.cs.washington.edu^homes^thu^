work world

 my research interests include operating systems, distributed and
parallel systems, networking, and security.  currently, with help from
my advisor, john
zahorjan, i'm building system support for running soft real-time
applications (e.g., visualization) on partially idle workstations in
nows.  recently, i completed a study on how runtime measurements of
application characteristics can be used by a runtime system to
minimize application execution time in uniprogrammed multiprocessors
environments as well as by a system scheduler to make &quot;good&quot;
global scheduling decisions in multiprogrammed multiprocessors
environments.

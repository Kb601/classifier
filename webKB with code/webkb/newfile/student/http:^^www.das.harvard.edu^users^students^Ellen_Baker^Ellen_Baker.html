research interests

 
i am currently a graduate student in computer science working with
margo seltzer.  we are working on the problem of searching large
facial image databases in the case where a user begins the search with
only a mental image of a sought-after face (e.g., the classic mug-shot
search problem).  we are looking into using representations (such as
eigenfaces) that have been applied successfully to database searching
in face-recognition tasks and incorporating them into face-creation
systems, so that a user can both create faces and search for them in a
database.
 
in previous work, we built the drawing evolver, which
enables a user to create drawings (including drawings of faces) with
an interactive genetic algorithm.  for a poster presentation about 
the drawing evolver click  here.  
 
a research paper on the drawing evolver can be accessed by clicking

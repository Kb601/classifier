research

sequential decision tasks appear in many practical real-world problems
including control, resource allocation, and routing.  such tasks can
be characterized by the following scenario: an agent observes a state
of a dynamic system and selects from a finite set of actions.  the
system then enters a new state upon which the agent must select
another action.  the system may return a payoff for each decision made
or for a sequence of decisions.  the objective is to select the
sequence of actions that return the highest total or cumulative
payoff.  in my research, i evolve neural networks with genetic
algorithms to learn and perform sequential decision tasks.  i am
particularly interested in tasks where problem-specific knowledge is
currently unavailable or costly to obtain.  some domains that i have
studied include game playing, intelligent control, and constraint
satisfaction.  for more information, see my  list of publications.

welcome aboard!    i am a ph.d candidate at
 computer science dept.,
 boston university.   i am currently 
a research assistant for
prof. azer bestavros, who is also my 
thesis advisor. 













 research philosophy &  domain



my three beliefs ...


i believe in `resource dispersion' to improve system performance
in networked computing environment.  there are other good reasons
in dispersing systems resource, but i am particularly interested 
in minimizing the bottleneck effect in networked computing 
environment through load dispersion.  

i believe in the
phrase, "the simpler, the faster", especially for the switch (router) 
architectures.  the higher the network bandwidth, the firmer i believe in it -- it does not make much sense to me that, messages stay longer in the switches (routers) while they move faster on the links - no real advantage!   

i also believe
in `feedback(closed_loop)-based flow controls' even under broadband networks,
since it provides some form of information on the network, 
whether the information is old or new.  recent studies have revealed that the
observed network traffic is self-similar, i.e., the pattern of network
traffic is invariant (to some extent)  on the time scales, which signifies that
the network traffic is long-term predictable.  the utilization of this notion 
goes against 
ancient egypt to control irrigation system for 
preventing flooding.  i speculate that the idea 
of using history(i.e., feedback) to predict the future (i.e., congestion) might 
provide a nicer solution for
flow control, especially in high-speed networks, if the feedback information is used right.

after all, we live in the world with history that repeats 
itself -- another self-similarity -- and people learn tomorrow
from history.  





  


current research interests include improving the perfomance (especially, in 
response time for real-time applications) of tcp under atm and other
broadband networks.    
  




 research groups


i am a proud member of 
real-time systems group and 
oceans research group.

ephemeral quote
the economist, summing up the results of
voting on 1996 ballot propositions:

money's usefulness apart, the moral of 1996 is clear: 
if you are a white male who wants to work for the
minimum wage, bilk small investors and smoke joints when you're ill,
california is the place to be.


research
i'm a 4th year phd student working with professor t.c. hu on combinatorial algorithms.

some of my other research interests are
 a machine learning
technique for time series analysis, and 
market mechanisms for distributed resource allocation.

administration
i run the 
cse copy coop, a way for grad students to get access to
copy machines in the building.  check it out.

affiliations
prior to coming to ucsd for graduate study i lived in japan for over two
years, studying japanese and supporting myself by working for
urban
translation as an editor and apprentice translator.  i still do a little
work for them occasionally, and am glad to see their multimedia and
web-related business is growing.

curiosities
when i'm not studying or surfing (in the ocean--not "web grazing"),
 i'm an avid reader (and 
an enemy of
television).  i'm starting to
collect a
list of  reading material that i've enjoyed
lately, including some comments and quotations.


anyone can be an inventor.
rick crawford's essay, techno prisoners


advocacy
lately i've been buried in work. if you too somehow missed the hubbub, check
out what's been happening with the
telecommunications bill.

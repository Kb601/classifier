 hi, i'm 22 (born in 1973),  5'3', 55kg. i hail from
 
      hyderabad, capital of 
      
      andhra pradesh, india. my address, phone no, and similar stuff
      are in my plan
       file.
 
 
 

      after four years of pleasant stay at
 indian institute of
technology, madras in my home country,
 india,
i was asked to
leave the place with an undergraduate degree in computer science.
 for those four years i lived at godavari
hostel. 

 
 

 
so here i am now, in 
new york city,
 at the  columbia university where
the dept. of computer science has
admitted me in the fond hope that someday
they can give me a ph.d.

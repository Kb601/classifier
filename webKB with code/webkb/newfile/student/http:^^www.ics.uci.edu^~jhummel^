 brief description: 

  compilers, program optimization, and data dependence testing in the presence 
of dynamic, pointer-based data structures.  


 long description: 

  data structures are important solution components in many programs, since
the proper choice of data structure can greatly impact the efficiency of
the resulting application.  this is well-known to fortran programmers, where
arrays serve as the primary data structure.  recently however, given the
increasing use of languages such as ada, c, c++, and fortran 90, data
structures built using pointers and dynamic memory allocation are more
prevalent.  these types of structures --- linked-lists, trees, dags --- present
new and difficult analysis and optimization problems for the compiler
writer.  the objective of our work is to solve these problems, thereby
enabling the parallelization of such codes.

  our approach is to create a data dependence testing framework targeted
towards program code involving dynamic, pointer-based data structures.  our
framework has three components: (1) property collection, (2) path collection,
and (3) dependence testing.  to enable accurate dependence testing, the
compiler must collect both information about the properties of the data
structure (e.g. tree vs. dag) and information about the memory locations
being manipulated in the data structure.  the former are represented as
axioms about the structure, the latter as paths through the structure.
given this information, the dependence testing component applies 
theorem proving, in a general and decidable way, to determine dependences
in the code.  

  to date we have implemented a prototype of our data dependence testing
framework, and successfully parallelized a number of important codes
involving complex data structures.  these codes include the n-body problem,
sparse matrices, and a 3d electromagnetic simulation based on bipartite
graphs.  speedups were linear to near-linear on a shared-memory
multiprocessor.

  our work is crucial to optimizing and parallelizing compilers, since
dependence information directly impacts the application of numerous
performance-enhancing transformations.  the more accurate the dependence
information, the more chances for optimization and parallelization
at all levels (from low-level instruction scheduling to source-level
loop transformations).  our work represents the first accurate and 
general mechanism for data dependence testing in the presense of 
dynamic, pointer-based data structures.

   sailing, teaching, and teaching sailing.  visits to washington, d.c. to
see beth.  in fact, here's a recent
 picture  of us in new zealand...

if you like sailing...  we sailed from fiji to new zealand 
aboard a 65' racing sloop owned and operated by orange coast college;
the boat is called alaska eagle, and is an old whitbread winner (flyer).
pictures?  here's a goofy
 picture  of me driving; a
 picture  of "a watch" (brad, 
scott [the skipper], myself, and ray [not pictured since he's driving]);
a  picture  of myself atop
roberts island (bay of islands, nz); and finally a
 picture  of a bunch of us
atop roberts island (facing the other way -- you can just make out
the mighty eagle anchored in the background, lower right).  what a trip!

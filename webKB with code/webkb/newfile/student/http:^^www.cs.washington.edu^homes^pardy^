first weeks of grad school


 
and a couple years later . . . . . 


 
  

i am a third year graduate student of computer science at the
university of washington.  currently, i do research in the area of
operating systems but i am also interasted in distributed systems,
languages, and compilers.  besides grad school, my life is filled with
the seattle drizzle, hiking and other outdoors activities (if i am not
busy enjoying the school or the drizzle), books and music.  

you can find a short description of my research  interests  and a 
resume  here.  there's also a list of my 
papers.  all of these are a bit outdated but that's what happens
when one has a busy schedule.

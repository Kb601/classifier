hello from vassily


long live may day!  :)

hello.  to start with, i am not really a web person.  the best link
i've come up with thus far is this: http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/vass/very useful documents
(it's also the shortest to write :).  

when www was young, i collected quite a few links and downloaded a few
files.  i have been expanding my collection since then.  all this
stuff is here:

selected links and quotes
russian home pages
various links
guides to html and forms



other links:


cse home page
uw home page
ncsa mosaic home page



recently i joined the uw cecil
project.  cecil is a cool pure object-oriented language and
vortex is an even cooler compiler infrastructure.  we will be
faster than c!  (maybe...)  here are papers we have written. 

as a member of the cs lab staff, i designed and implemented the
mvis system -- www-assisted access to our
departmental room and visitor database.  (recently it has been
upgraded by other staff people.)

my quals project was expanding the
zpl language
to handle irregular data structures (represented by graphs) and
dynamically repartitioned data (both graphs and arrays).

here is my
quals writeup (329k, 47 pages).
for a short overview, check out the
slides
from my presentation (29 pages/slides).

also, i have collected a few links to
resources related to the project.

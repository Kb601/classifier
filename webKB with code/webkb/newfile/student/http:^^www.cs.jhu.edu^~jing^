i am a second year graduate student in the computer science department at the johns hopkins university. i graduated with a bs degree from tsinghua university, beijing, china. this is a  picture of me which used to be here.



 computer graphics projects written in java: 

applet #1: midpoint line algorithm 
 applet #2: perspective view of wireframe images

 i worked on a virtual reality project this summer, dealing with goggles, data gloves, 3d sound, etc. a lot of fun. i will put something about it here later when i have time.  see you then.

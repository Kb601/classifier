food

i enjoy cooking. some people say i should open a restaurant. some of
people's favorite dishes include stir-fried rice noodles and my bbq beef
skewers. my recipes are now on-line. 

toys

being a computer geek, i have computers
and cool toys. 

taiwanese

i am also promoting the use of the taiwanese
language. i am currently developing computer tools for taiwanese. be sure
to check out my new experimental on-line taiwanese
dictionary. though not absolutely required, these pages are best viewed
if you install chinese character fonts. 
if you are using a java-enabled browser like netscape, you should be
able to see my &quot;java-oke&quot; (tm) applet, with a yellow ball 
bouncing
over barney the purple dynosaur.

 contact info: 
	i am finishing my phd in absentia at the university of illinois,
	urbana-champaign.  my address there is:




	center for supercomputing research and development
	university of illinois, urbana-champaign
	room 410 csrl, 1308 w. main st., urbana il 61801 
	office:  (217) 244-0070




 research project: 

	as part of my thesis work i designed and developed 
	eve,
	a retargetable,
	parallelizing compiler for fine-grain parallel architectures.
	my general research interests include parallel algorithms and
	architectures, parallelizing compilers, and hardware/software
	codesign.

 leisure activities: 

  despite what my advisor may tell you, ;-) i don't actually have much free time,
  but i have been known to


 	dance israeli folk dances (favorite dance:  shorashim)
	i don't go regularly any longer, but if you are interested
	in giving it a try, let me know.  i still enjoy going from
	time to time.

 	jump out of airplanes:  i've only done this twice, but i am
	totally hooked.  as soon as i scrape up the time and money
	i'm going again.  anyone interested in joining me?  [i can
	get you $10 off... ;-)]

 	hurtle down mountainsides:  skiing is a recent
	hobby for me.  once i discovered the homomorphism that mapped my
	childhood sport of ice hockey to skiing, i was off (just imagine
	playing ice hockey with really long skates on an inclined surface ---
	everything else is the same, especially if you get in my way ;-> ).

	ride a bike:  my wife and i are working up to our first "century"
	(100 mile) trip, from newport beach to san diego.


 	read:  my favorite authors are toni morrison 
	(especially her books "song of soloman" and "beloved") 
	and don delillo (especially "the names" and "ratner's star").

 	dabble in foreign languages:  right now, i just
	try to re-acquire whatever limited foreign language abilities i ever had.
	languages that i forget more and more of on a daily basis are
	hebrew (i can still speak, read, and write, but not very well),
	spanish (can't speak or write, but for some strange reason i can
	understand a lot), and japanese (i just nod knowingly).

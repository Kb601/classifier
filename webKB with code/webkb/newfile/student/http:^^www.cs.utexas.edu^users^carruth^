 introduction 

i am a ph.d. candidate at  ut-austin  in the
 department of computer
sciences.
my supervising professor is  jayadev misra  and my
dissertation topic is 
 
 real-time unity. 
i am a member of professor misra's 
 psp research group. 

i am extending the 
 unity 
theory in order to express finite time bounds
on the usual unity operators for progress and safety.  i am also
interested in functional programming languages, partial order
semantics and automated theorem proving.

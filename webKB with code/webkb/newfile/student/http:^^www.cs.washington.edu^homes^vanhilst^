mike is starting his 7th year as a graduate student at the university of 
washington.  hopefully, with a little luck he will be finished around the
end of the winter quarter.
  

immediately prior to coming to udub mike worked as a contractor at
ibm research 
where he wrote 
motif 
widgets for the user unterface of ibm's
data explorer.

mike got his start as a programmer in 1981 while fixing and maintaining
computer hardware for the 
smithsonian 
astrophysical observatory, which is part of the 
smithsonian, but located within 
harvard.
learning to debug software was the only way mike could convince the 
programmers that the hardware really was working correctly. 
mike stayed at the smithsonian for 8 years, during which time he wrote a 
program called 
saoimage
which is used by lots of astronomers to look at images.  saoimage is now 
part of the 
gnu
distribution.  (mike would like to thank bill wyatt,
eric mandel,
joe schwarz, and 
doug mink
for starting, guiding, and continuing the project,
not to mention countless others who contributed).

in 1986, mike took a year off to work with a group of 
seismologists
in paris, france, doing data acquisition, calibration, and analysis.  
he had a truly wonderful time in 
paris. 
he met his wife, luz angela, in a french language class at the
alliance francaise.
luz angela had come to paris that year from her native 
colombia
in south america.


in the summer of 1994, mike wrote a front end to let students
browse the university's time schedule data base through uwin.
he had fun working with the very talented staff at 

computing and communications (the folks who brought you 
pine.)
special thanks to bill shirey, who did most of the design, and 
tracy stenvik, who wrote the uwin screen library.
(if you are on a uw machine, you can run 
uwin here.)

in between working on the time schedule mike also taught beginning 
programming, through the uw extension, to a very motivated group from
microsoft product support who sacrificed their summer to learn c.

recently mike has presented papers at the

international symposium on object technologies for advanced software
(isotas'96),

acm conference on object oriented programming systems, languages, and 
applications (oopsla'96), and the

acm sigsoft symposium on the foundations of software engineering (fse'96)
he also presented a poster at oopsla'95, made presentations at the 
subjectivity workshops at oopsla'94 and oopsla'96, participated in the 
doctoral symposium at oopsla'95, and participated in a demo at 
uist'96 (thanks steve).


in an earlier life mike earned bs and mcp degrees in
architecture
(the wooden kind) and 
city planning
from 
mit
and worked as the community development director for
the city of grinnell, 
iowa.
while the things he works on are different now, the skills in visual
design and problem solving continue to be of value - and he still 
gets to talk about 
chris 
alexander.

here in seattle, mike has been active in the student chapter of the 

washington software association,
improving ties between students and large and small software 
companies in the area.  he enjoys hiking, cross-country skiing, 
sailing, and
kayaking.
he also enjoys swimming at lake bronson.

more recently, mike's "free" time has been taken up by 
marco harold sebastien van hilst, who was born on may 10, 1996.
mike will post pictures as soon as he locates another photo scanner.






 visits since 8 november 1996.

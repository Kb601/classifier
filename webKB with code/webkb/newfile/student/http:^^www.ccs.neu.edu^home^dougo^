      welcome.

      hi!  my name's doug.  this is my page. 

      i am a grad student at
      northeastern university.

      i hope to get a phd in
      computer science before the next
      millenium.  i'm currently planning to study the technological
      aspects of muds.

      i'm currently taking two classes:
      
	 operating systems (com 3360) with
	  prof. john casey
	 computer architecture (com 3200) with
	  prof. gene cooperman
	  
	  textbook: computer architecture: a quantitative approach, second edition
	  by david a. patterson
	  and john l. hennessy.
	  
      

      i'm also working as a research assistant for
      prof. karl lieberherr;
      my current project is
      demeter/java.  we just submitted a research demonstration proposal for icse 97.
      

      if you're in the boston area, you might want to come to one of
      several seminars that are held at northeastern (in room 107 of
      cullinane hall):

      
	 programming language semantics, wednesdays 9:30am-11:30am
	 cryptography, thursdays 10:00am-11:45am
	 demeter, fridays 10:00am-12noon
	 distributed systems, fridays 1:00pm-2:30pm
      

      

      i used to work at pure software.  i
      still work for them, from my apartment in
      boston, massachusetts,
      in my
      copious free time. 

      i'm a little wary of the growing cult of
	netscape.  but hey, i use it too, and jamie
	zawinski is a cool guy.  after all, he also wrote
      xemacs.  maybe if had written
      gnuscape
      too i would have better luck getting it to work... 

      i conducted a poll of chugchanga-l members for their
	favorite records of 1995. 

      i've made some mix tapes of music i like. 

      i drive a 1993
      honda civic.
      

      there are a bunch more links in my bookmarks
	file. 

      

      
      
      (this is a cool logo that i did for my xface for the
      csua.
      try standing on your head.)

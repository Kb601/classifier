 9/5/96 - server is fixed!  give it a try. 

 note:  this page is only interesting if you follow the directions, download the
viewer and look at the models.

i am currently working with tony
derose, david salesin, werner stuetzle, tom duchamp, and jovan popovic on the 3d-scanning
project.  i am currently building a viewer which you can download here (requires sgi
graphics workstation).

our paper is here.

here. -->

once you have the viewer, you can use it to look at our models,
once you have modified netscape in this way. (it should
also work with other browsers if you modify them in a similar way).

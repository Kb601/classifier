random blurb
welcome to christian's home page.  he isn't here in person to tell you
about himself, so this page will have to do.

christian just graduated from  
stanford university
where he completed his b.s. in 
computer science.  
he is now at mit
in a ph.d. program in the 
ai lab there.  

christian just gave up downtime
to scott so that
the interactive top ten list
can live on at its present address when he departs 
stanford.  of course, this doesn't
really mean he gave up his machine, but rather just the name.  in fact,
this isn't the first time this has happened.  downtime has had a long hidden
history.


when christian was an undergrad, he used to
section lead the cs106
courses and dance with the 

stanford vintage dance ensemble.  both are outstanding groups that
helped to make his undergraduate years wonderful ones.


many of christian's
friends
are on the web.  you can stop by and visit them.

christian just wrapped up his undergraduate research in computational
molecular biology.  he has co-authored 
one paper
on this work.


christian is also excited to announce that his
dad
is on the web.  go dad!

well, here i am.  the other uw.  this www page is just a copy
of my other home
page at the university of waterloo.
when i have some more time, i'll modify this page to be more appropriate to
my current situation.


one enjoyable experience i had near the end of being an undergraduate
was the grad ball.  here are some photos from
the ball.

that second enjoyable experience occured saturday, may 25th, 1996.  i 
addressed the convocation as valedictorian.  i cannot express how honoured 
i felt that such a wonderful graduating class should choose to have me 
represent them in this way.  incidentally, for those of you who didn't know, 
my parents found out i was valedictorian about ten minutes before the start 
of the ceremony.  my mom says she'll never forgive me.  

the text of my valedictorian address can be found here,
for anyone who's curious.

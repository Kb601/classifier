warning!  i'm trying to update this page so it's pretty messy right
now.


hi!  i'm matt.  i'm a second-year ph.d. student in the
computer science program at
ucsd.  i just returned to my
schoolwork after a nice summer
working at encyclopaedia
britannica.
i am a recent transplant to
san diego from
raleigh,
north carolina, where
i got my m.s. in n.c. state's
computer science program.

speaking of north carolina, if you want to help rid the u.s. senate of
jesse helms (doesn't everyone?) send money to harvey gantt.  he's a pretty good
guy.

my current research interest is connectionist vision and face
recognition.  i am working with gary cottrell, so i am a
member of gary and
eric's unbelievable research unit (geuru).  i'm not in the group
picture (waahh) but i am a geuron.


here's some professional-type stuff:
my resume in html
and postscript, and my
master's thesis (gzipped postscript).


if for some crazy reason you want to know where i am right now, my
schedule may help.



a few things i like




surfing
(under construction!).




veganism.
you should too! why?





the volkswagen bus!










coffee shops.
this saic link is broken.  maybe i'll start my own sd coffee shop
page.  in my spare time, that is.



live music.





.




chiles!

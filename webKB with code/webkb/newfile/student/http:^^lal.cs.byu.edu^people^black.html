where he is pursuing a ph.d. in computer science.  he began his ph.d.
program at 
uc berkeley, and
transferred to byu in 1993.  his research interests are
formal verification of software and software engineering.


black earned an ms in computer science at the 
university of utah
in 1983 and a bs in mathematics at 
southern utah state college (now
southern utah university) in 1973.  he
has 17 years industrial experience developing ic design and

finished projects


i taught scientific
programming - c.


notes on my lecture to the software engineering course on

formal methods

on the
composition of the universe

the orbiter
discovery's
visit to utah.



other, less directed links


i've put together some web sites and collections.  here
are some i'm especially happy with and links to other miscellaneous
on-line stuff of mine.



the

emily dickinson home page including an

archive of a discussion list and links to over
370 of her poems on-line.


i led a group consisting of most of my oo class in building a hypertext

osa tutorial.  there are 

links to on-line quizes, but the quiz program is currently
(21mar96) not working.


as an experiment in html graphics and interfaces, i designed some
pages to resemble

control panels on the enterprise.


to help a professor, i put the

language and learning across curriculum committee on line,
converting their
bibliography,
brochure,
etc. to html.


learning hol lessons.

goal directed proof (#1),

induction (#2),

the assumption list (#4).

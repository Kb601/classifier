college of computing, at
thegeorgia institute
of technology.

he is a member of the telecommunications/networking group.
bobby®'s research interests include network
protocols, protocol environments, operating systems, distributed
computing, and network management.  the 
protocol playground has more information on his current work.



bobby® received a b.s.c.s in engineering from the
university of florida along time ago.  after working for a 3 letter
computer company that got bought by a 3 letter long-distance company
(and then sold again) (and getting married to a fabulous babe), bobby®
returned to pursue phd studies, here at the college of computing.  he
was awarded a m.s. in computer science in june of 1993.  he is
currently pursing a phd and had hoped to be out of here by the olympics
but that (obviously) didn't happen.  bobby® does
not like to be called 'robert', 'bob®', 'rob', or 'robby'.  he
simply prefers bobby®.

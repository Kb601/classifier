thanks for stopping by my home page.  i am a graduate student in the department of computer science at the university of pittsburgh.  my area of concentration is artificial intelligence.


 and this will be me if i ever get a job...

if you like you can email me at lentini@cs.pitt.edu 

i earned my b.s. in computer science at millersville university and was involved in research at millersville university's intelligent machines laboratory... try running the heuristic search methods prolog demo!!.






 current research projects 

"scaling up inductive machine learning with massive parallelism"
masters project:  nsf-funded project involves inductive rule learning using huge datasets containing both symbolic and numeric data types (check out uci for some machine learning info).  the system being used is parallel virtual machine (pvm) running on a cray t3d at the pittsburgh supercomputing center.  the principal investigator of the project is dr. bruce buchanan, and the project supervisor is john aronis.

"using machine learning to learn feedback procedure in intelligent game tutoring systems"
the tutoring system will teach the user the winning strategy of the 2-player strategy board game connections.  the question to be answered is whether machine learning can be used to determine appropriate times to give feedback as well as which type(s) of feedback should be given.  the finished product should be general enough to serve most students well.  the learning method being used is a multilayered feed-forward neural network.

"assessing human performance during combined visual, auditory, and vestibular stimulation"
afosr-funded project involves providing combined sensory stimulation to improve studies of human spatial orientation and disorientation during multi-sensory input. response measures include both measures of extraocular movements and straightforward measures of subject performance such as the ability to perform simple arithmetic and to perform visual pattern recognition tasks.  the hardware being used is the mirovideo dc20 professional digital video editing system, the power dac 3-d audio rendering system from tucker-davis technologies, and an off-vertical axis rotation (ovar) chair.  this project is being worked on in conjuction with the balance disorders division of the department of otolaryngology, university of pittsburgh school of medicine.

a great new company that designs and maintains home pages for the web is cyclomedia.


or if you want to create your own home page, click here to see how.

check out a virtual reality project (adapted to the web by sheldon smoker).

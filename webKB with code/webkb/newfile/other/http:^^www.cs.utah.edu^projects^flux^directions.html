directions from salt lake airport to the computer
science department


exiting the airport, follow the signs for i-80 east towards the city.
immediately after leaving the airport on i-80, take the north temple
street exit off 
i-80, and go straight on it (you will be headed east, towards the
mountains and the downtown area).

stay on north temple street into the city, until you come to state street
(which is the same as 100 east street).  
there will be a high-rise office building on the corner on your right 
when you reach state street.  turn right onto state street, and go
two blocks to 
100 south street.  turn left onto 100 south street.  (you should again
be headed east, towards the mountains.)

stay on 100 south street, heading east, through town and past the stop 
lights at 1300 east street, then university street, then wolcott 
street.  after wolcott street, the road takes a 90 degree curve
to the left, then another 90 degree curve back to the right. after this
curve back towards the right, 
our building - the merrill engineering building - will be the first building 
on the right, a low black glass box set back off the street.  enter the 
north parking lot, and park at one of the meters adjacent to the 
building.

the computer science office is in the near right (north west) corner, 
third floor, room 3190.  go to the office and they will call teresa or one of 
our project staff who can get you a parking pass and escort you up 
to our offices.

 information on salt lake hotels 



university park hotel

the hotel closest to the university is the university park hotel.
it is a nice hotel and has government room rates, but is farther
from downtown salt lake than some other hotels.  in good weather
it is within walking distance to the university, and it would likely
take only about 5 minutes to drive from the hotel to anywhere on
campus.

if you follow the directions from the salt lake airport to the
computer science department, you can easily continue on to the
university park hotel.  here are the additional directions:

when you are heading east
(towards the mountain) up 100 south street, where you would normally
turn right into the merrill engineering building parking lot, don't
turn, but rather keep
driving east untill you come to the next right, which is wasatch blvd.
(there is no light at wasatch blvd.)
turn right onto wasatch blvd.  now you should be heading south, with 
the mountains on your left.  stay on wasatch blvd, and you will go
through two stop lights.  at the 3rd stop light you come to, you 
will be at foothill blvd, and you will have to turn either right
or left.  turn left.  at the very next light, which is wakara way,
turn left again.  you are now headed east towards the mountains
again, on wakara way.  the university park hotel is on the left
side of the street, and should be the first building you come to.

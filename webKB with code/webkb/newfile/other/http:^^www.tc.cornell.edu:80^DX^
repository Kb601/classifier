data explorer



data explorer repository 


the data explorer repository is brought to you by the  cornell 
theory center and  ibm.  
ibm's visualization data explorer, an extensible visualization 
environment, provides an easy to use interface for
visual programming and computation on a variety of 
workstations.  this repository allows dx users and researchers to share
expertise and customized programs.

"teaching computer graphics and scientific visualization using the dataflow
block diagram language dataexplorer" - from forefronts newsletter,
fall, 1993

ctc lab exercises for researchers 






tips and macros 
combinations of modules which produce useful new functions

 


student projects:


(dx v.2.0 1993-1994)        


 (dx v.2.0 1994-1995)  


 (dx v.2.0 and v.3 1995-1996)  

the projects are mostly modules written in c which extend the function
of dx. some projects use dx for data analysis, and some are related graphics
applications, including x-windows and pc-based projects.            





chemistry extensions 
 this suite of modules and macros is designed to facilitate molecular 
 modeling with the ibm aix visualization data explorer software package. 
 our intent here is not to reproduce or replace any existing modeling packages
 but rather to provide a highly flexible environment for constructing
 visual programs uniquely tailored to specific research applications.
 this package also includes tools designed to facilitate chemistry animation
	production.




data input filters 
data input filters for fluent version 1, fluent version 2, phoenics, and
plot3d data are described.




extensions 
this directory contains the following subdirectories:
macros for annotation, import and export, rendering, texture mapping, time
keeping, transformation, vectors and matrices,  other macros and modules.





utilities 
the following conversion routines and filters can be found in this directory:
arctools, boundingbox, dx.to.abekas, dxf2dx, gen_dx_header, 
sas to dx, and modpath.dx, which converts output of the usgs modpath program 
into dx format.




earth and space sciences  
this directory contains example programs, macros, colormaps, utilities, etc.
for use with the ibm visualization data explorer (version 2.1) on workstations,
especially for the earth and space sciences.  all of the data are in the
public domain and unless otherwise noted are provided courtesy of the national
space science data center at nasa/goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md.

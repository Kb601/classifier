vision


finished the textbook "machine vision". this book is not very well written, there are some errors , some confusing notations, and it lacks the technical detail. but the last one may be the strength of the book, in a sense that you can get a big picture of each field in computer vision quickly. this is the reason i can finish the book in one month. i feel i really enjoy this field. the next book i may read is "3-d computer vision". a very good book, lots of math in it. this may distract many but attract me.  

learned the vista and used it to do the hw1. i feel vista is very useful tool for computer vision research. for example, the command line parser function is neat and i feel it could be include in the standard c lib.

read the first paper "visual information processing" by d. marr and h. nishihara. i am totally lost. i just don't know what they were talking about.



database


read the first paper ""granularity of locks and degrees of consistency in a shared database" by gray, j., et al.. this is a good paper and there are some good ideas in it.

finished the first 6 chapters of the book "database management systems"  by r. ramakrishnan. this will give me the useful background for database. 

read the introduction about minibase. i printed out all the cs764 final reports, but only quickly glanced some of them. i still didn't make up my mind to read them. there is no much theoretical value there, i just want to know what the database looks like in a real system.



network


read a bsd socket reference and get the idea of how to write network program. i don't like network very much although it's very useful and will develop very rapidly in future. there are lots of protocol there and you just have to remember every thing. i hate to remember. 



misc.


organize a go game. it was successful.
read two books about how to interview and write two notes: one is my collected tip from book "the interview game: winning strategies for
the job seeker" by john j. komar. another is my answer to 25 possible interview questions, the ref. is "101 great answers to the toughest interview questions" by ron fry . 
interviewed with company cisco. it's a network company and is developing very rapidly. i predict that network will enlarge its market greatly in future, especially as the development of netscape. thousands of new customer linked to the net every day or even every hour, which means an continuously increasing demand for network. this is the reason why i am interested in cisco. i think it was a nice talk with interviewer, and gained some useful experience for the next interview.
learned driving!!! the biggest accomplishment of the month.



plan for next month


continue read the book""database management systems". 
begin read book "3-d computer vision". 
begin think of the project topics of database and computer vision.  
look briefly the cs764 report.
read the papers in reading list of the two courses.
attend another 3 interviews.

the neither theory revision system 

neither  

neither is a propositional theory refinement system that will modify a
incomplete or incorrect rule base so as to make it consistent with a
set of input training examples.  neither has been extended to revise
both horn clauses and m-of-n rules.  an iterative greedy method is
used to efficiently compute repairs. 

neither has also been used as part of separate system, assert, which
performs student modeling.  assert (acquiring stereotypical student
errors using refinement of theories) is an intelligent tutoring system
which inputs a knowledge base describing a domain and a set of student
errors on that domain and outputs a tutoring program tailored to fit
student needs.  student behavior on the domain is modeled by
collecting any refinements to the knowledge base (made by neither)
that were necessary to account for the student's behavior.  these
models are then used to generated feedback which should help raise
student peformance on that domain. 

the complete neither software system is available via 
anonymous ftp.
this software contains the following items:  

 
 the assert tutoring system 
 the cpp system - the specifics of a c++ tutorial 
 the neither system 
 pfoil - a propositional foil induction system
 a system introduction and breakdown, including compilation 
instructions and execution traces.

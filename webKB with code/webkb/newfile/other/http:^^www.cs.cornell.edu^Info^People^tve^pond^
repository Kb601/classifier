tve's pond page
(i'm still working on it - the pond and the pond page...)


somehow during the spring of '95 i felt compelled to do some real

digging and building, as opposed to digging up bugs and building
vaporware. the house and garden offered plenty of opportunities for
such entertainment and i had to decide on where to start with
remodeling.

we had been bothered by the noise from the road passing in
front of the house while sitting in our covered porch for a while, so
fixing that seemed like a good idea. we decided to build a solid fence
to screen the porch from the cars and to place a retaining wall
extending the down-hill wall of the house to the property line. this
would form a level "patio" around the porch which we wanted to
landscape in a japanese style.



i started drawing plans, buying wood, and then digging. during some
evening, after a sweaty day digging, sawing and hammering, we looked
into one too many gardening books and got bitten by the pond bug. the
perspective of having a nice surface of water with beautiful water plants
right there in front of our porch sounded just too wonderful. it then
occurred to me that i could relatively easily adapt the construction to
create a pond: i only needed to dig a bit deeper, or so i thought.


well, it turned out to be a little more involved than that! first i had
to reinforce the whole construction a bit to make sure it would not
yield under the weight of the water. and then the whole process of
lining the pond took a lot more time than filling the hole behind the
retaining wall with dirt would have.

i had the wise idea to take a couple of pictures during the constrution
which i'm making available here. you might wonder why i do this.  well,
very simply because i found pete's pond
page very inspiring and helpful while planning the construction of
my own pond. so i hope that others get inspired seeing my pond and find
it helpful to see how someone else did things.

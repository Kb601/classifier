mvpe



the maisie visual programming environment (mvpe)
is an x-windows based graphical front-end for designing parallel
simulations in maisie, a parallel
(message-passing) extension of c.  it is written in c++ using motif.
it is similar in intent to opnet (which simulates networks), and
sesworkbench.  the primary advantage of mvpe over
these commercial systems is its direct use of a parallel simulation
language.





features

 entities (entity types) are specified using an extended flow
chart notation (sample)
 simulations can be designed hierarchically with arbitrary depth
 static communication topology is specified graphically
 automatic code generation, compilation, and execution

among the extensions planned for future releases are:

 automatic partitioning
 runtime animation
 metrics collection
 libraries of predefined entities

mvpe: visual design of parallel simulation models

proceedings of the fourth international workshop on modeling, analysis,
and simulation of computer and telecommunication systems, feb. 1-3, 1996,
san jose, ca, pp. 227-230.

(gzipped postscript)

abstract: simulation is an increasingly important aspect of network development, and parallelization of these simulations can result in tremendous time/performance improvements.  however, tools for developing and parallelizaing simulations are sadly lacking.  this paper describes mvpe, a visual programming environment for parallel simulation design.





this research has been funded as part of the
wamis and 
travler projects.

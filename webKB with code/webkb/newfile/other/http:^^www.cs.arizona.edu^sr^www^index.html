the sr programming language



the sr programming language

 sr (synchronizing resources) is a language for writing concurrent
programs.
the main language constructs are resources and operations.
resources encapsulate processes and variables they share;
operations provide the primary mechanism for process interaction.
sr provides a novel integration of the mechanisms for invoking
and servicing operations.
consequently, all of local and remote procedure call, rendezvous,
message passing, dynamic process creation, multicast,
and semaphores are supported.
sr also supports shared global variables and operations.

 sr has been used at a number of universities and labs for course work
and research projects involving concurrent programming.  it has been used in
concurrent programming courses to reinforce concepts with small programming
projects and with larger projects such as experiments with parallel
algorithms,  replicated databases, distributed simulations, and parts of
distributed operating systems such as file systems and command interpreters.
sr has also been used as a tool in several masters theses and doctoral
dissertations to conduct experiments in parallel and distributed programming
and to implement larger systems such as a system for mixed language
programming, one for distributed implementation of graph algorithms,
experiments with load balancing algorithms, and experiments with upcall
program structures.

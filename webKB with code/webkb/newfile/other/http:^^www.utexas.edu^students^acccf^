        and 24th street.) sometimes we have special arrange-
        ments. please refer to our schedule. 
    &nbsp;
    what does it mean to be a christian? 
    christians are those who have given their life over to
        jesus christ. one way of describing what christians is by
        their basis, doctrine, life, and obedience. a christian's
        basis of authority is god's word, the bible. 
    &nbsp;
    our basic beliefs 
    
            there is and will forever be only one true god, inseparable,
                almighty, all-knowing, good, eternally self-existing
                in three distinct persons, the father, son, and
                holy spirit. god is loving, kind, merciful; righteous, stern,
                holy; and sovereign, just, and trustworthy. 
            the sixty-six books of the bible are the inspired word of
                god, without error in the original manuscripts.
                it is authoritative, trustworthy, and complete.
                it is precious to us, and we try to understand,
                live, and obey it as jesus and the biblical writers
                meant. 
            god both created and sustains all creatures,
                angels, demons, and all the universe for his
                glory. people are and will not be god, but all
                people are made in god's image. since the fall
                people are sinful before god. all the earth was
                good, but since the fall it is imperfect and now
                under satan's control. 
            jesus was born of the virgin mary and is fully
                man and fully god. he came to earth to die as an
                atoning sacrifice for our sins to completely save
                us and purify us from all unrighteousness. he was
                bodily raised from the dead. there is no other
                way to go to heaven except through god's only
                begotten son. jesus christ will personally return
                in power and glory in the second coming. 
            after death believers go to conscious eternal
                bliss with god in heaven and then in the new
                heaven and earth. unbelievers go to conscious
                eternal torment away from god in hell and then
                the lake of fire. 
        
    
    our basic experience 
    
            some of us converted to christianity from other backgrounds;
                others of us were raised in christian families.
                regardless, all christians have repented of their
                sins, believed god, and asked god to come into their
                life as their lord. we no longer live only for ourselves,
                but in everything, work, play, and study, we do
                our best to glorify god. we no longer live by ourselves,
                but the holy spirit dwells in all believers. 
            we rely on god and not ourselves not only for his free gift
                of salvation, but also for preserving us and transforming
                us by his holy spirit. we must examine ourselves
                though, for counterfeit christians can be deceived.
                while we are declared righteous by god, we still
                sin while on earth, and the holy spirit is sanctifying us
                so that we can live sinlessly in heaven. 
            our christian life is centered around god. and involves 1)
                be nurtured in god's word, 2) fellowship and
                loving others, 3) evangelism, mission, and discipling,
                and 4) worship and prayer. while we study, work,
                play, as help people as others do, we do this
                things to live lives pleasing to god, trusting in god
                rather than ourselves, and enjoying being in god's
                love. 
            obedient christians may still at times be down, disappointed,
                suffering, persecuted, but god never ceases to
                love us deeply. he is there strengthening and renewing
                us. we also love one another deeply, both in joyful
                celebration and helping others through hard
                times. 
        
    
    our basic practice 
    
            in all things, true christians strive to please
                our lord. we strive to obey the greatest
                commandment and love our lord with all we are. we
                worship none except the true god. we do not
                engage in the occult, superstition, idols, or give
                religious worship to any others. we must not
                worship through graven images. since we fully
                love god and are devoted to him, we spend time reading his
                word, meditating on him, praying, and worshipping him. 
            we strive to obey god's command to be holy and christlike.
                we strive to have integrity in our whole life, not
                to defraud or hurt others. we do not cheat. we
                are temples of the holy spirit and we honor god
                with our bodies by not getting drunk, high on drugs,
                or abusing our bodies. we turn away from worldly
                passions, material extravagance, and selfish ambition. we
                give god our lives, money, and time. 
            we strive to obey god's command to love others as ourselves.
                we are kind towards all, but especially towards
                those in need. rather than being proud, we regard
                others' needs as greater or equal to our own. we
                do not want to hurt others physically, or by gossip, slander,
                stumbling others, or a lack of love. we honor our
                parents, governments, and we obey all laws that
                do not conflict with god's laws. 
            we work together with other christians, in ours
                and other fellowships, to share the gospel,
                nurture, exhort, and encourage believers, oppose
                evil and guard against error, and in general to
                be salt and light in this world.

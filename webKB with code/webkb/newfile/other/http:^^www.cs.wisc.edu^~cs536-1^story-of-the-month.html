great moments in engineering !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


in a recent issue of meat & poultry magazine, editors quoted from
"feathers," the publication of the california poultry industry federation,
telling the following story:

the us federal aviation administration has a unique device for testing the
strength of windshields on airplanes.  the device is a gun that launches a
dead chicken at a plane's windshield at approximately the speed the plane
flies.

the theory is that if the windshield doesn't crack from the carcass impact,
it'll survive a real collision with a bird during flight.

it seems the british were very interested in this and wanted to test a
windshield on a brand new, speedy locomotive they're developing.  they
borrowed faa's chicken launcher, loaded the chicken and fired.

the ballistic chicken shattered the windshield, broke the engineer's chair
and embedded itself in the back wall of the engine's cab.  the british were
stunned and asked the faa to recheck the test to see if everything was done
correctly.

the faa reviewed the test thoroughly and had one recommendation:

use a thawed chicken.

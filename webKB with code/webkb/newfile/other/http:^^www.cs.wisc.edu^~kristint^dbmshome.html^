uw dbms software projects.
information, technical reports, and (sometimes) source code are
available for the following uw dbms software packages:

 coral, a deductive dbms.
 exodus/e,
an extensible object-oriented database system toolkit
 oo7, an oodbms benchmark.
 paradise, a
geographic information system built on shore.
 shore, a
high-performance, scalable, persistent object repository. 
 zetasim, a parallel dbms simulator.  (link under construction)
 zoo, a database system for scientific experiment management (link
under construction)



dbms-related mailing lists
we maintain two mailing lists targeted toward the uw dbms community:

 dbseminar is for announcements about dbms-related talks
and academic activities in the department.  the weekly database
seminar is usually held friday afternoons at 1:15pm, in 2310 cs.
 dbpilgrims is for announcements of social events
(especially "pilgrimages" to the memorial union), birthday cake
distributions, and other
diversions.  though targeted at the dbms group, we welcome
wannabes.


to subscribe to either of these lists: these lists are
maintained via the listproc package.  to subscribe to a list, send
e-mail to listproc@cs.wisc.edu, with a message (not a subject line!)
containing only the words:

subscribe &lt;list name&gt; &lt;your name in real life&gt;

as an example, one database wannabe might send the message:

to: listproc@cs.wisc.edu
subject: i wannabe!

subscribe dbpilgrims alan turing

unsubscribing is similar:

to: listproc@cs.wisc.edu
subject: can't make it any more

unsubscribe dbpilgrims



pointers to other database information

the best source of additional database-related information is the

acm-sigmod home page.


paul
aoki maintains a list of pointers 
to  other
random dbms information.

michael ley maintains a compendium of info on database systems and logic programming.

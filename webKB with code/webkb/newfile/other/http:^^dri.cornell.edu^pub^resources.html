dri information



search dri public files

full test search of files on our www server and archives of dri mailing lists.
or browse through the file system tree.

software environments pages

the design research institute
the home page for our web server, this is our "front door" to the
rest of the world.




meta-servers 

these are the "yellow pages" of the internet.  some of these are lists
or collections of "good sites" which you browse visually, and others
are search systems (you fill in a form, and it tells you what it has).
the advantage of the lists are that if they are not too long, you can
search them by eye, and if they are well organized, you can search
quickly.  the search systems are usually much larger, and often
contain information gathered by automatic agents which exhaustively
traverse the entire web.  unfortunately no single one of these
systems is the best.  you will certainly want to try at least the first
three.

searches

the first three are all very powerful and comprehensive.

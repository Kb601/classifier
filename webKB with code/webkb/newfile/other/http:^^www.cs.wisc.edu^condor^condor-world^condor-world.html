exchange of information regarding the condor software developed at the
university of wisconsin - madison, computer sciences department.
condor-world should serve as a means to exchange information and
experience relating to condor.  we would also like to use it as a
channel for comments, wishes and complaints regarding the system.  as
we continue to work on the problem of batch processing in a cluster of
workstations, we would like to know what you think about the
system.

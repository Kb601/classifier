 cs6 java on the pc

 


a few people have attempted to put java on their pc's.
the following is a rough outline of the steps necessary
to move the
hmcsupport
library to a pc
and to create a working
classpath
once you have installed the 
1.0.2



ftp the directories and all their files
from
 /home/osiris/cs/cs5/java
files and store them in 2 directories,
e.g.,

c:\java\lib\acme
and
c:\java\lib\hmc

note, that if you use
ws-ftp
then entire directories can be ftp'ed
otherwise, individual files would need to be ftp'ed.
look at "the whole internet"
for a discussion of ways to ftp entire directories.


add the line

set classpath=.;c:\java\lib\classes.zip;c:\java\lib

to the autoexec.bat file.

note:
the
classes.zip
stays "ziped".
it is part of the jdk.


reboot


note:
you can send mail to:
pc-system-l@hmc.edu,
the general pc mail list at hmc,
for any pc related questions and issues.

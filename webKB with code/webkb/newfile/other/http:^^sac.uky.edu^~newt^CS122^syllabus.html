grading policy:

         programs                           30%
	 homework, quizzes, and
	    class participation             25%
         first exam                         15%
         second exam                        15%
         final exam                         15%

   your class participation grade will be determined by your attendance
   in class and your active participation in class discussions.  i
   teach my classes in a highly interactive manner, so come prepared
   each day with something constructive to say about our current
   topic!

   all exams and quizzes will be closed book.

   quizzes will be given during class and usually will be unannounced.
   there will be no makeup of missed quizzes unless you have a valid
   university excused absence.

   there will be two regular exams and a final exam.  all three exams
   should be considered as cumulative, and will be administered in our
   regular classroom.

   assignments will be made throughout the semester and may include
   readings, homeworks to be done on a word-processor, and programming
   assignments.  homework and programming assignments are considered
   separate.

   homework assignments are strictly due on the date specified.  since
   we may go over the answer to homeworks in class, no late homework
   assignments will be accepted.  all homework submission must be
   word-processed  -- hand-written homework assignment submissions
   will neither be accepted nor graded.

   programming assignments will also have a specified due date.
   programming assignments turned in after this date will be penalized
   5% per day (not counting weekends and holidays), and no programming
   assignment will be accepted after it is more than 5 days late.
   after that time, you will get no credit for the late assignment, so
   be sure to turn in your programming assignments on time!  homeworks
   and programs are treated as separate assignments, and should be
   turned in separately.

   assignments will be announced primarily in class and on the cs122
   world-wide-web home page.  additional information regarding
   assignments may be sent by e-mail.  be sure to bring a copy of all
   assignments to class for review and clarification.

   all papers to be turned in should be organized in a neat and orderly
   fashion.  pages of printouts should be gathered in order and stapled
   in the upper left corner to make a 'booklet'.  your name should be
   written by hand on the front page, in the upper right-hand corner.

   not all assignments will have the same grading weight as others.
   the weighting of each assignment will generally be indicated when
   assigned.

   the programming assignments will require more than just typing a
   c++ program into the computer and running it.  these requirements
   will be discussed in detail in class and in additional files.

   i highly recommend your buying and using the text.


incompletes:

   the university policy on the grade of incomplete (i) will be adhered
   to strictly.  the grade of i will only be granted in extraordinary
   circumstances.  for this reason, if circumstances indicate that you
   may not be able to successfully complete the coursework, you should
   strongly consider withdrawing, auditing, or changing your grade
   option to pass/fail (if a grade is not needed).  come see me
   immediately if you become concerned about this.


cheating:

   cheating on tests, programs or homework will not be tolerated.
   university policy dictates that the minimum penalty for cheating is
   to receive a grade of "e" for the course.

   as for what constitutes cheating on a program, any direct use of
   another's program, or allowing another the direct use of your
   program will be considered cheating.  ideas may be discussed between
   students, but coordinated writing or using of code is cheating, even
   if variable names, format, comments, etc.  are different.  person or
   persons using another's code, as well as the person whose code is
   being used, will all be considered guilty of cheating.


computer accounts:

   this semester will will be using unix accounts on hp computers in
   the library microlabs, called "sac.uky.edu".  be careful to treat
   your computer account as you would your personal and confidential
   records.  be sure to change your password frequently, choosing a
   password which is not easy to guess.  be sure to protect your
   account (via the "chmod" command in unix) so that others cannot read
   your files.  and, most importantly, don't abuse the system by doing
   things which are inconsiderate, annoying, or disruptive to other
   users, or destructive to other accounts.  your right to use the uk
   computer systems can be taken away if you abuse the privilege.

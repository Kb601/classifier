cse 557: intro to computer graphics
 autumn quarter 1995

getting into the class

if you are a cse graduate student you should be
able to sign up for the course directly.


otherwise, if you have satisfied the prerequisites but are not
currently a cse graduate student, you may still try coming to the first
class.  we'll accommodate as many as we can, but we are severely
limited by the number of machines in our instructional
lab.

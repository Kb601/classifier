quiz #2 for friday september 27

5 questions, 25 points total




1. (8 points) 

a.  express 22.4 (base 10) in base 2.


22 (base 10) is 10110 (binary)

.4 (base 10) is .0110 where all digits repeat


so, 22.4 (base 10) is 10110.011001100110. . .


b.  express 10011.011 (base 2) in base 4.


103.12




c.  express c03 (hexadecimal) in octal.


c    0    3

1100 0000 0011

110 000 000 011

6   0   0   3


d.  express 123 (base 5) in base 10.


1 x 5**2 + 2 x 5**1 + 3 x 5**0

  25     +   10     +  3

  38



2. (4 points)  what is the output of the following sal program?


  .data
str:     .ascii "why?\n"
ch1:     .byte 'x'
ch2:     .byte 'x'
counter: .word  0
newline: .byte '\n'
int:     .word  0

  .text
__start:  puts str
          putc ch1
          putc ch2
	  putc newline

	  move int, ch1
	  put  int
          done




why?

xxxx

120



3. (6 points)  

a.  give an 8-bit two's complement representation for the decimal value -46.


+46 is 00101110

so, -46 is 11010001+1 = 11010010


b.  what decimal value does the 8-bit sign magnitude value 00100011 represent?


1 x 2**5 + 1 x 2**1 + 1 x 2**0

32       + 2        + 1

35


c.  give a 6-bit biased-20 representation for the decimal value -5.


-5 (true value) + 20 (bias) = 15

15 represented in 6-bit unsigned is 001111



4. (4 points)  
a modified floating point representation is defined.  it is just like the ieee floating point standard, except for a few modifications.  it is a 12-bit representation. the exponent field is 4 bits, and uses two's complement representation.  what decimal value is represented by 0xa46 in this modified floating point representation?


negative number!

1 0100 1000110

don't forget the hidden bit!

1.1000110 x 2**4

11000.11 (base 2)

24.75 --> -24.75



5. (3 points)  
give the ieee single precision floating point representation for the decimal value 6.125.  show the result in both binary and hexadecimal.


6 (base 10) is 110 (base 2)

.125 (base 10) is 1/8 or .001 (base 2)

6.125 (base 10) is 110.001 (base 2)

normalized, we get 1.10001 x 2**2

the exponent field is 2 (true value) + 127 (bias) = 129,
   represented in 8-bit unsigned, 10000001.


the number is positive, so the sign bit is a 0.


in binary,

0 10000001 10001000000000000000000

in hexadecimal,

0100 0000 1100 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000

0x40c40000

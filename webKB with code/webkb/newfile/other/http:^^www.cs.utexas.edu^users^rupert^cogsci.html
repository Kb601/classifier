what is cognitive science?





well, it would not be enough for a book to define the term "cognitive 
science."  it is a relatively new academic decipline, touching quite a number
of areas: philosophy, mathematics, computer sciences, anthropoloy, linguistics,
neurobiology, architecture and psychology.  its aim is to discover the essence 
of human intelligence and how it could be simulated by formal computation like 
that of the computer's.  a lot of researhes have been going on since the 70's.

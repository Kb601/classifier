i have an interdisciplinary background  comprising computer science, 
 high energy physics (hep), and nonlinear optics. i have worked in
 two experimental collaborations of physicists, cleo (cornell) and
  opal (cern), and have authored and co-authored over 100 research
 papers. but the following  lists of
  publications and invited talks are a good representation of
 my contribution to physics research:

in nonlinear optics, i
 studied the propagation of very high intensity electromagnetic waves
 in nonlinear media such as optical fibers in form of optical solitons.
 i constructed and solved
 the equations governing this highly nonlinear dynamics. 

 my research work in hep
 has been in testing the quantum
 theory of
 nuclear force known as quantum chromodynamics (qcd).   
 i conducted my doctoral research while
 working on the opal experiment at cern. my work contributed to what is now
 known as the first clear experimental evidence in support of a salient 
 feature of qcd  that the strength of nuclear force between the nuclear
 particles
 decreases as the particles get closer, the so called principle of asymptotic
 freedom. at cern, i also managed the 
  off-line data monitoring of the zed chamber, a part of the opal detector
 designed to measure z-coordinates of the particle tracks. 
 
 i initiated and carried out the tests of qcd
 during my postdoctoral research work on the cleo experiment at wilson
 laboratory of nuclear studies, cornell
 university. there, i also headed the offline data reconstruction efforts
 for the cleo collaboration. 
 the complexities in handling these large data sets have given rise to
  an nsf funded collaborative project, 
  nile , of computer scientists
   and physicists
   in distributed computing. this is a prime example of how the 
  requirements of hep
 experiments push on the limits of computer
 technology. (this is also a reason why you should not ask me: what the
 heck are you doing here in computer science after earning a phd
  in physics?)  

  if you still see a contradiction between computics and physics, 
  translate your questions to:



 why world wide web, which is so popular these days among business and
    computer communities, was developed at cern, the physics lab? 

  why the computer was invented, in the first place, for computations
      for physicists?



 so for me, computer science and physics are the branches of the same tree.

 this paper describes {\bf dienst} -- a distributed interactive extensible network server for techreports. the dienst protocol is based on the world wide web protocol http, and provides an object-oriented interface to a document model. the document model allows one to access the document as a whole or by named sub-parts and it supports multiple formats for the document. we have also implemented a gateway from a web server that supports the dienst protocol. using a world wide web client (e.g. mosaic), a user may search for documents at distributed sites, browse ``thumbnail'' (very small page) images, view the full documents, and print them.

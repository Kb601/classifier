mail stop for uwcse  


uw box numbers

the university of washington is changing the way mail is delivered.
once upon a time, the cse department was addressed by sending mail
to mail stop ``fr-35''.
now it's addressed by sending it to ``box 325350''.
rumor has it that it's important that the address
appears in the order
university of washington, box number.
that is:


department of computer science & engineering
university of washington
box 352350
seattle, washington 98195 usa 

 what's that ``fr-35''? 

what's that ``fr-35'' in the old address?
it's the mail stop for the

	department of computer science & engineering.
the ``fr'' comes from the building that cs&e used to be in.

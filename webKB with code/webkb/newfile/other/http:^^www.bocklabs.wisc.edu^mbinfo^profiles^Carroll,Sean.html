research description:
our research is directed towards gaining a comprehensive picture of how genes act to establish the basic body plan of the fruit fly and other insects.  by combining genetic and embryological approaches with molecular techniques for analyzing the structure and expression of key genes that control the fate of groups of cells, we are elucidating the developmental regulatory mechanisms that guide the formation of embryos and body parts.  the genes controlling the basic body pattern are fundamental to understanding the origin of the different body structures found in arthopods and other segmented animals.  using our knowledge of drosophila, we are studying the developmental and genetic basis of body pattern evolution.

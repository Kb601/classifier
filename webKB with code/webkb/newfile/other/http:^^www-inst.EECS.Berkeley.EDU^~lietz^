vrml samples

the following models are elements from the soda hall model created by the berkeley walkthru project led by professor carlo sequin.  this 3-dimensional building model is used as the basis for various research projects, many of which focus on the issues of real-time interactive environments.  in conjunction with the walkthrough group, i converted the soda hall model from its original format, unigrafix, to vrml. 


note: a vrml browser is required to see the following images in their full glory.  otherwise, you will have to simply revel in the splendid code.

happy hour


i'm adam seligman, a second year masters student, and i currently run
an informal happy hour that happens roughly every week during the
year.  although i'm the gracs social chair (and president of vice, i
suspect), this isn't an official cs department or gracs event.
students, faculty, staff, significant and insignificant others are all
welcome.  we usually get together on friday evenings between 5-7pm,
subject to my whim.  some people drink beer, others drink soda, we all
eat chips and salsa and generally have a good time. i have a list of
people interested, to whom i send a weekly mail telling you when and
where to meet.

drop me a note saying you'd like to be added to the list, and i'll let you
know before each happy hour.  it's a great way to get to know some of
the people in the department you might not meet otherwise, and to get the
scoop on the in's and out's of ut's cs program.

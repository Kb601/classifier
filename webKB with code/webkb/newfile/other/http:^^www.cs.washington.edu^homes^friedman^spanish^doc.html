      it by clicking on the word.

       help! 

      the dictionary desparately needs a free electronic dictionary to
      use as its starting point.  right now, the dictionary is based
      on a 1200-word piece of junk, and is useless until we get a
      larger one.  if you know of one, contact

       disclaimers.
      
      the dictionary is provided free of charge, with no promises about 
      quality.  actually, i do make one promise about quality--the quality
      of the underlying wordlist sucks!

       help collaborate! 

      when i've finished writing the interface, you will be able to
      correct definitions and conjugations, as well as add new words.

       features. 

      the dictionary can deduce forms from stems of verbs, nouns, and
      adjectives.  at first, it tries to deduce the various stems of a
      verb from the infinitive as though they were regular.  it does
      final-consonant changes (coger, averiguar) correctly.  it will
      be wrong at first for stem-changing verbs, until the correct
      stems are entered.  wildly irregular verbs and are not handled.

the transform programmer is a package of programs for the pc under ms-windows
which work together to support exploratory learning and enjoyable activities
involving geometric transformations.

the transform programmer consists of three main parts -- (a) an image
processing and display subsystem called the "metip programming environment,"
(b) a programming language interpreter, in this case, the xlisp-stat system of
david betz and luke tierney, and (c) a particular lisp program that
facilitates the manipulation of mathematical expressions.  the first
component, metip programming environment, provides a user interface very much
like that of the pixel calculator program.  the differences are that multiple
images can be handled at the same time, that the program contains the
capability to transform images in complicated ways according to user-specified
formulas, and that the image display and transformation functions can be
commanded from the programming language as well as directly by the user.  the
programming language makes it possible to explore computer programmming and
image processing together, if students or teachers so desire.



the transform programmer allows the specification of a general mathematical
formula to apply to one or more source images.  the general nature of the
interface allows for a high degree of exprimentation on the part of the
student and supports interactive activities.  the formula can be expressed in
cartesian or polar coordinates and allows for the value of a pixel in the
result image to be a function of arbitrary pixels in the source image(s).

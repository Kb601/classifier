 personal information 

i'm a graduate student in the deptarment of computer science at the
university of washington. 

 my roots 

my home town is a small place called sakleshpur, in the state of 
karnataka
in india. back in 1956,
after his retirement, my grandfather bought some land near sakleshpur and
developed a coffee estate. the area around sakleshpur is ideal for growing
coffee, and most of the coffee grown and exported by india comes from this
region. it's a mountainous region with volcanic soil and heavy (100+ inches
a year) rainfall. the estate is now being run by my parents. one day, i'll
be there too.

i grew up in bangalore
(formerly known as the garden city -- now known as the silicon city),
which is the capital of karnataka. it's about 150 miles east of
sakleshpur. bangalore has changed a whole lot in the past 5 years, 
with all those high-tech multinationals opening shop and pouring in
big bucks. 


other stuff
indiaworld has up to date news from
india, and articles from indian newspapers and magazines.

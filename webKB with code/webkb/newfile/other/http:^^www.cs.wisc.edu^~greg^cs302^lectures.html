class notes



class notes

i am posting two different versions of the class notes.
both versions have the same information.

the microsoft word version is 1 to a page.
the postscript version is 2 to a page.
printing the postscript version saves paper.

you can view and print the postscript versions from the vectra lab.  
netscape will ask "what should i do with this ps file?"

to print the file, choose "print to lpt1/laser queue"
to view the file, choose "view postscript file with ghostview" 


do not print out both the word version and the postscript version.
they are the same.

do not print the postscript version using ghostview.  
you will not be satisfied with the results.

if you have printing problems, stop by my office (cs 1307).
i will give you a copy to photocopy.

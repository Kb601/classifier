paradyn is a performance measurement tool for parallel and distributed
programs.
paradyn uses several novel technologies so that it
scales to long running programs (hours or days)
and large (thousand node) systems,
and automates much of the search for performance bottlenecks.
it can provide precise performance data down to the procedure and
statement level.

paradyn is based on a dynamic notion of performance instrumentation and
measurement.
unmodified executable files are placed into execution and then
performance instrumentation is inserted into the application
program and modified during execution.
the instrumentation is controlled by the performance consultant module,
that automatically directs the placement of instrumentation.
the performance consultant
has a well-defined notion of performance bottlenecks and program
structure, so that it can associate bottlenecks with specific causes and
specific parts of a program.
paradyn controls its instrumentation overhead by monitoring the cost of
its data collection, limiting its instrumentation to a (user controllable)
threshold.

the instrumentation in paradyn can easily be configured to accept new
operating system, hardware, and application specific performance data.
it also provides an open interface for performance visualization,
and a simple programming library to allow these visualizations to interface
to paradyn.

paradyn can gather and present performance data in terms of high-level
parallel languages (such as data parallel fortran) and can measure programs
on massively parallel computers, workstation clusters, and heterogeneous
combinations of these systems.

an adaptive cost model for parallel program instrumentation
jeffrey k. hollingsworth and barton p. miller.
europar '96 (lyon, france, august 1996).

software based instrumentation is frequently used to measure the
performance of parallel and distributed programs.  however, using
software instrumentation can introduce serious perturbation of the
program being measured.  in this paper we present a new data collection
cost system that provides programmers with feedback about the impact
data collection is having on their application.  in addition, we introduce
a technique that permits programmers to define the perturbation their
application can tolerate and then we are able to regulate the amount of
instrumentation to ensure that threshold is not exceeded.  we also
describe an implementation of the cost model and presents results from
using it to measure the instrumentation overhead for several real
applications.



dynamic program instrumentation for scalable performance tools
jeffrey k. hollingsworth, barton p. miller, and jon cargille.
shpcc (knoxville tn, may 1994)  

in this paper, we present a new technique called dynamic
instrumentation that provides efficient, scaleable, yet detailed
data collection for large-scale parallel applications.  our
approach is unique because it defers inserting any instrumentation
until the application is in execution.  we can insert or change
instrumentation at any time during execution.  instrumentation is
inserted by modifying the application's binary image.  this permits
us to insert only the instrumentation that is necessary for the
current analysis being performed or visualization presented.  as a
result, our technique collects several orders of magnitude less
data than traditional data collection approaches.  we have
implemented a prototype of our dynamic instrumentation on the
thinking machines cm-5, and present results for several real
applications.  in addition, we include recommendations to operating
system designers, compiler writers, and computer architects about
the features necessary to to permit efficient monitoring of
large-scale parallel systems.

dynamic control of performance monitoring on large scale 
parallel systems
jeffrey k. hollingsworth and barton p. miller.
international conference on supercomputing (tokyo, july 19-23, 1993).

performance monitoring of large scale parallel computers creates a
dilemma: we need to collect detailed information to find performance
bottlenecks, yet collecting all this data can introduce serious data
collection bottlenecks.  at the same time, users are being inundated
with volumes of complex graphs and tables that require a performance
expert to interpret.  we present a new approach called the
w cubed search model, that addresses both these problems by
combining dynamic on-the-fly selection of what performance data to
collect with decision support to assist users with the selection and
presentation of performance data.  our goal is to provide users with
answers to their performance questions and at the same time
dramatically reduce the volume of performance data we need to collect.
we present a case study describing how a prototype implementation of
our technique was able to identify the bottlenecks in three real
programs.  in addition, we were able to reduce the amount of
performance data collected by a factor ranging from 13 to 700 compared
to traditional sampling and trace based instrumentation techniques.
finding bottlenecks in large-scale parallel programs
jeffrey k. hollingsworth. ph.d. thesis, august 1994.

note: this paper contains several color postscript pages.

this thesis addresses the problem of trying to locate the source of
performance bottlenecks in large-scale parallel and distributed
applications.  performance monitoring creates a dilemma: identifying a
bottleneck necessitates collecting detailed information, yet collecting
all this data can introduce serious data collection bottlenecks.  at
the same time, users are being inundated with volumes of complex graphs
and tables that require a performance expert to interpret.  i have
developed a new approach that addresses both these problems by
combining dynamic on-the-fly selection of what performance data to
collect with decision support to assist users with the selection and
presentation of performance data.  the approach is called the w3 search
model (pronounced w-cubed).  to make it possible to implement the w3
search model, i have developed a new monitoring technique for parallel
programs called dynamic instrumentation.  the premise of my work is
that not only is it possible to do on-line performance debugging, but
for large scale parallelism it is mandatory.

the w3 search model closes the loop between data collection and
analysis.  searching for a performance problem is an iterative process
of refining the answers to three questions:  why is the application
performing poorly, where is the bottleneck, and when does the problem
occur.  to answer the why question, tests are conducted to identify the
type of bottleneck (e.g., synchronization, i/o, computation).
answering the where question isolates a performance bottleneck to a
specific resource used by the program (e.g., a disk system, a
synchronization variable, or a procedure).  answering when a problem
occurs, tries to isolate a bottleneck to a specific phase of the
program's execution.

dynamic instrumentation differs from traditional data collection
because it defers selecting what data to collect until the program is
running.  this permits insertion and alteration of the instrumentation
during program execution.  it also features a new type of data
collection that combines the low data volume of sampling with the
accuracy of tracing.  instrumentation to precisely count and time
events is inserted by dynamically modifying the binary program.  these
counters and timers are then periodically sampled to provide
intermediate values to the w3 search model.  based on this intermediate
data, changes are made in the instrumentation to collect more
information to further isolate the bottleneck.

i have built a prototype implementation of the w3 search model and of
dynamic instrumentation.  the prototype runs on thinking machine's cm-5
and a network of workstations running pvm.  in one study, the tools
identified the bottlenecks in several real programs using two to three
orders of magnitude less data than traditional techniques.  in another
study, dynamic instrumentation was used to monitor long running
programs and introduced less than 10% perturbation.  while the w3
search model and dynamic instrumentation complement each other, they
are also useful individually.  the w3 search model can be applied to
existing post-mortem performance tools or even to simulated machines
and environments.  dynamic instrumentation has be used to collect
performance data for other uses including visualization.  the w3 search
model and dynamic instrumentation are being incorporated into the
paradyn performance tools.
mapping performance data for high-level and data views of
parallel program performance

programs written in high-level parallel languages need profiling
tools that provide performance data in terms of the semantics of
the high-level language. but high-level performance data can be
incomplete when the cause of a performance problem cannot be
explained in terms of the semantics of the language. we also need
the ability to view the performance of the underlying mechanisms
used by the language and correlate the underlying activity to the
language source code. the key techniques for providing these
performance views is the ability to map low-level performance
data up to the language abstractions.

we identify the various kinds of mapping information that needs
to be gathered to support multiple views of performance data and
describe how we can mine mapping information from the compiler
and run-time environment. we also describe how we use this
information to produce performance data at the higher levels, and
how we present this data in terms of both the code and parallel
data structures.

we have developed an implementation of these mapping techniques
for the data parallel cm fortran language running on the tmc cm-
5. we have augmented the paradyn parallel performance tools with
these mapping and high-level language facilities and used them to
study several real data parallel fortran (cm fortran)
applications. our mapping and high-level language techniques
allowed us to quickly understand these applications and modify
them to obtain significant performance improvements.
mechanisms for mapping high-level parallel performance data

a primary problem in the performance measurement of 
high-level parallel programming languages is to map 
low-level events to high-level programming constructs. 
we discuss several aspects of this problem and presents 
three methods with which performance tools can map 
performance data and provide accurate performance 
information to programmers. in particular, we discuss 
static mapping, dynamic mapping, and a new technique 
that uses a data structure called the set of active sentences.
because each of these methods requires coopera
tion between compilers and performance tools, we 
describe the nature and amount of cooperation required. 
the three mapping methods are orthogonal; we describe 
how they should be combined in a complete tool. 
although we concentrate on mapping upward through 
layers of abstraction, our techniques are independent of 
mapping direction.
a performance tool for high-level parallel programming languages
r. bruce irvin and barton p. miller.
ifip wg10.3 working conference on programming environments for massively parallel distributed systems (ascona switzerland, april 1994)

users of high-level parallel programming languages require accurate
performance information that is relevant to their source code.
furthermore, when their programs cause performance problems at the
lowest levels of their hardware and software systems, programmers need
to be able to peel back layers of abstraction to examine low-level
problems while maintaining references to the high-level source code
that ultimately caused the problem.  in this paper, we present nv, a
model for the explanation of performance information for programs
built on multiple levels of abstraction.  in nv, a level of
abstraction includes a collection of nouns (code and data objects),
verbs (activities), and performance information measured for the nouns
and verbs.  performance information is mapped from level to level to
maintain the relationships between low-level activities and high-level
code, even when such relationships are implicit.

we have used the nv model to build paramap, a performance tool for the
cm fortran language that has, in practice, guided us to substantial
improvements in real cm fortran applications.  we describe the design
and implementation of our tool and show how its simple tabular and
graphical performance displays helped us to find performance problems
in two applications.  in each case, we found that performance
information at all levels was most useful when related to parallel cm
fortran arrays, and that we could subsequently reduce each
application's execution time by more than half.


integrated visualization of parallel program performance data

siam press, j. dongarra and b. tourancheau, eds., 1996

    performance tuning a parallel application involves integrating
    performance data from many components of the system, including the
    message passing library, performance monitoring tool, resource
    manager, operating system, and the application itself. the current
    practice of visualizing these data streams using a separate,
    customized tool for each source is inconvenient from a usability
    perspective, and there is no easy way to visualize the data in an
    integrated fashion.  we demonstrate a solution to this problem using
    devise, a generic visualization tool which is designed to allow an
    arbitrary number of different but related data streams to be
    integrated and explored visually in a flexible manner.  we display
    data emanating from a variety of sources side by side in three case
    studies.  first we interface the paradyn parallel performance tool and
    devise, using two simple data export modules and paradyn's simple
    visualization interface.  we show several devise/paradyn
    visualizations which are useful for performance tuning parallel codes,
    and which incorporate data from unix utilities and application output.
    next we describe the visualization of trace data from a parallel
    application running in a condor cluster of workstations. finally we
    demonstrate the utility of devise visualizations in a study of condor
    cluster activity.

paradyn is a performance tool for large-scale parallel applications.
by using dynamic instrumentation and automating the search for bottlenecks,
it can measure long running applications on production-sized data sets.
paradyn has recently been ported to measure native pvm applications.

programmers run their unmodified pvm application programs with paradyn.
paradyn automatically inserts and modifies instrumentation during the
execution of the application,
systematically searching for the causes of performance problems.
in most cases, paradyn can isolate major causes of performance problems,
and the part of the program that is responsible the problem.

paradyn currently runs on the thinking machine cm-5, sun workstations, and pvm
(currently only on suns).
it can measure heterogeneous programs across any of these platforms.

this paper presents an overview of paradyn, describes the new facility in
pvm that supports paradyn, and reports experience with pvm applications.

optimizing array distributions in data-parallel programs
krishna kunchithapadam and barton p. miller. 
languages and compilers for parallel computing, 
august 1994.

data parallel programs are sensitive to the distribution of data across
processor nodes.
we formulate the reduction of inter-node communication as an
optimization on a colored graph.
we present a technique that records the run time inter-node communication caused
by the movement of array data between nodes during execution and builds
the colored graph, and provide a simple algorithm that optimizes the
coloring of this graph to describe new data distributions that would
result in less inter-node communication.
from the distribution information, we write compiler pragmas to be used
in the application program.

using these techniques, we traced the execution of a real data-parallel
application (written in cm fortran) and collected the array access
information.
we computed new distributions that should provide an overall reduction in
program execution time.
however, compiler optimizations and
poor interfaces between the compiler and runtime systems counteracted any
potential benefit from the new data layouts.
in this context, we provide a set of recommendations for compiler
writers that we think are needed to both write efficient programs and to
build the next generation of tools for parallel systems.

the techniques that we have developed form the basis for future work in
monitoring array access patterns and generate on-the-fly
redistributions of arrays.

performance measurement tools for high-level parallel programming languages


r. bruce irvin. ph.d. thesis, october 1995.

note: this paper contains several color postscript pages.

users of high-level parallel programming languages require accurate
performance information that is relevant to their source code. furthermore,
when their programs experience performance problems at the lowest levels of
their hardware and software systems, programmers need to be able to peel
back layers of abstraction to examine low-level problems while maintaining
references to the high-level source code that ultimately caused the
problem. this dissertation addresses the problems associated with providing
useful performance data to users of high-level parallel programming
languages. in particular it describes techniques for providing source-level
performance data to programmers, for mapping performance data among
multiple layers of abstraction, and for providing data-oriented views of
performance.

we present nv, a model for the explanation of performance information for
high-level parallel language programs. in nv, a level of abstraction
includes a collection of nouns (code and data objects), verbs (activities),
and performance information measured for the nouns and verbs. performance
information is mapped from level to level to maintain relationships between
low-level activities and high-level code, even when such relationships are
implicit.

the nv model has helped us to implement support for performance measurement
of high-level parallel language applications in two performance measurement
tools (paramap and paradyn). we describe the design and implementation of
these tools and show how they provide performance information for cm
fortran programmers.

finally, we present results of measurement studies in which we have used
paramap and paradyn to improve the performance of a variety of real cm
fortran applications running on cm-5 parallel computers. in each case, we
found that overall performance trends could be observed at the source code
level and that both data views and code views of performance were useful.
we found that some performance problems could not be explained at the
source code level. in these cases, we used the performance tools to examine
lower levels of abstraction to find performance problems. we found that
low-level information was most useful when related to source-level code
structures and (especially) data structures. finally, we made relatively
small changes to the applications' source code to achieve substantial
performance improvements.


integrating a debugger and a performance tool for steering
krishna kunchithapadam
and barton p. miller.

steering is a performance optimization idiom applicable to many problem
domains.
it allows control and performance tuning to take place during program
execution.
steering emphasizes the optimization and control of the performance of
a program using mechanisms that are external to the program.
performance measurement tools and symbolic debuggers already independently
provide some of the mechanisms needed to implement a steering tool.
in this paper we describe a configuration that integrates a performance
tool, paradyn, and a debugger to build a steering environment.

the steering configuration allows fast prototyping of steering policies,
and provides support for both interactive and automated steering.

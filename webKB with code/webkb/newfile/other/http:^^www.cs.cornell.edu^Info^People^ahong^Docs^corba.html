the corba standards documentation



soley, richard and stone, christopher, eds.  the object management 
	architecture guide.  rev. 3.0.  john wiley & sons and object 
	management group, framingham, ma, 1995.

	this is the definitive, overview guide to the terminology, objectives,
 	and the specification of corba.  it introduces the object management 
	group (omg) core object model, the omg reference model, the 
	standardization procedures, the proposal procedures, and specification 
	guidelines of omg.  the omg reference model consists of the four 
	layers:  the object request broker (orb), corbaservices, 
	corbafacilities, and application objects of which the first three are 
	described in detail in their own specification texts.


object management group.  the common object request broker:  architecture 
	and specification.  rev. 2.0.  object management group, 
	framingham, ma, 1995.

	the object request broker (orb) is the foundation of corba.  orbs are
	essentially agents that transparently service data requests/responses 
	from corba objects and clients through object adaptors (oa) via an 
	object-oriented version of an rpc mechanism.  the interfacing between 
	orbs and corba objects via the interface definition language (idl) and 
	the dynamic invocation interface (dii) are also specified.  revision 
	2.0 also defines interoperability and portability guidelines for orbs 
	from different vendors.


object management group.  corbaservices:  common object services 
	specifications.  object management group, framingham, ma, 1995.

	corbaservices (better known as coss for common object services 
	specification in literature) is the layer directly above orbs that 
	provide a recognized set of essential services available to corba 
	objects.  this is a "growing" document in that not all envisioned 
	services have been defined yet.  some of the specified ones include 
	naming, events, transactions, and persistence.


object management group.  corbafacilities:  common facilities. object 
	management group, framingham, ma, 1995.

	corbafacilities is the layer above corbaservices that defines higher-
	level services and functions for the fourth layer -- end-user 
	applications -- of the omg reference model.  it includes both 
	horizontal and vertical corbafacilities which are mostly introduced 
	but have yet to be specified as of this writing.  this is a "growing" 
	document as well.

tutorials



minton, gabriel.  "programming with corba."  unix review 14, 4 (april 
	1996), 29-39.

	this is an up-to-date and easy-to-read tutorial on corba.  it provides 
	background history on omg, summarizes the information in the defining 
	specifications on corba (first four entries of this bibliography), and 
	presents an interface definition language (idl) and c++ coding example 
	using sunsoft's neo corba environment. 


vinoski, steve.  "distributed object computing with corba."  c++ report
	5, 6 (july/aug. 1993), 32-38.

	this technical overview of the corba foundations explains how corba 
	makes sense from the perspective of distributed object-oriented 
	application development with c++.  it describes the corba components 
	-- the object request broker (orb) core, the interface definition 
	language (idl), the dynamic inovation interface (dii), the interface 
	repository (ir), and the object adapter (oa) -- individually as well 
	as how they work together.


betz, mark.  "building a corba object server."  software development 3, 
	10 (oct. 1995), 53-61.

	it is straightforward for proficient c++ programmers to develop a 
	corba object server using c++ and orbix -- iona technologies' corba 
	implementation.  the process is demonstrated in a detailed step-by-step
	manner, from idl interface specification to compilation of the example.
	


mowbray, thomas j. and zahavi, r.  the essential corba: systems integration 
	using distributed objects.  john wiley & sons and object 
	management group, framingham, ma, 1995.

	this book is geared towards systems integrators who are building 
	systems based on corba.  the book examines overall integration issues 
	and techniques; includes a good tutorial on the corba architecture; 
	discusses security issues and implementations; and introduces example 
	orbs available on the market so that successful corba systems can be 
	implemented.

shortfalls and problems



maffeis, silvano.  "adding group communication and fault-tolerance to 
	corba."  in proceedings of the 1995 usenix conference on 
	object-oriented technologies.  (monterey, ca, june 1995).  usenix 
	asso., berkeley, ca, pp. 203, 135-146.

	although corba is meant for distributed systems, one shortfall is its 
	lack of dealing with fault-tolerance, which could be implemented in 
	software as groups of replicated objects that utilize reliable 
	multicast communication.  recognizing this limitation, the author 
	presents and discusses electra -- "the best of both worlds," a generic 
	object request broker (orb) that adds the reliable group multicast 
	capabilities of systems such as horus and isis to a corba 
	implementation.


schmidt, d. c., harrison, t., and al-shaer, e.  "object-oriented components 
	for high-speed network programming."  in proceedings of the usenix 
	conference on object-oriented technologies.  (monterey, ca, june 
	1995).  usenix asso., berkeley, ca, pp. 203, 21-38.

	this paper presents another problem with corba.  it evaluates 
	performance problems of "communication middleware" on high-speed 
	networks; corba-based mechanisms (like orbix and orbeline), which 
	are considerably slower, are compared against c/c++-based sockets.  
	the authors also devised a middleground adaptive communications 
	environment (ace) object-oriented programming toolkit that improves 
	the performance problems they have encountered.


orfali, r., harkey, d., and edwards, j.  "client/server components: corba 
	meets opendoc."  object magazine 5, 4 (may 1995), 55-59.

	corbafacilities specifies higher-level services and functions for the 
	application objects layer of the omg reference model; however, most of 
	these have been introduced but have yet to be specified.  opendoc, 
	which essentially provides what corbafacilities requires, is mature 
	and is anticipated to be merged into or adopted by the corbafacilities 
	specification (this has occurred as of the writing of this bibliography
 	and has been named distributed document component facility).  opendoc 
	enables the creation of multiple "live data," or live object, compound 
	documents.  


tisaranni, john v.  "iona's orbix:  object request broker."  object 
	magazine 5, 5 (july/aug. 1995), 82+.

	iona technologies' orbix is one of the most popular, commercially 
	available, full implementations of corba.  the author reviews versions 
	of orbix that adheres to the corba 1.2 spec but focuses on orbix
 	extensions that are not defined in corba, such as object binding, 
	smart proxies, idl-c++ binding, and more; some of these have become 
	part of the corba 2.0 spec.  work with other companies to further 
	address shortfalls of corba are also briefly mentioned.  for instance,
	orbix+isis provides fault-tolerance functionality.

different perspectives, comparison to options




bernstein, philip a.  "middleware:  a model for distributed system 
	services."  communications of the acm 29, 2 (february 1996), 
	86-98.

	corba is not the only mechanism/middleware that is intended to 
	support	distributed computing; various competing models exist.  this 
	paper provides an educational look at how the heterogeneity and 
	distributed nature of industry needs and requirements gave birth to 
	middleware; classifies middleware; and discusses services that 
	middleware should provide.  middleware integration issues and its 
	future are examined as well.  


schmidt, douglas c. and vinoski, steve.  "modeling distributed object 
	applications."  c++ report 7, 2 (feb. 1995), 64-68.

	this is second in a series of columns on distributed object computing 
	(doc).  it outlines an approach to doc implementation by discussing the
	application environment and requirements (hardware, network, etc.) and 
	examining key functionalities to look for in competing doc frameworks 
	(corba, network ole, and oodce).  for example, corba does not have 
	security measures or multithreading capability; however, some of these 
	have become part of the latest specification.


brando, thom.  "comparing corba & dce."  object magazine 6, 1 (march 
	1996), 52-57.

	this is an informative guide to corba through comparison with dce 
	because of their numerous similarities, the author dispels confusion 
	by explaining corba through contrasting the differences between 
	corba and dce.  the paper includes a clear diagram showing the omg 
	reference model and depicting specified and yet to be specified 
	corba components.  


foody, michael a.  "ole and com vs. corba."  unix review 14, 4 (april 
	1996), 43-45.

	microsoft's component object model (com) is the defining object model 
	for the popular object linking and embedding (ole) for desktop 
	applications.  com's object model is quite different from corba's, 
	which makes interoperability between the two difficult.  omg has 
	completed the com-corba interoperability specification; however, 
	distributed com, contained in network ole (see next entry), is still 
	being defined and may pose a greater challenge for interoperability 
	specification between the two.


halfhill, tom r. and salamone, salvatore.  "components everywhere."  
	byte 21, 1 (jan. 1996), 97+.

	network object linking and embedding (network ole) from microsoft and 
	corba 2.0 from the object management group are compared.  corba 2.0 
	is already available with years of refinement; especially the new 2.0 
	specification has added additional portability and distributed 
	computing enhancements.  although network ole is not available yet, 
	microsoft's strategies and ole 2.0 availability make network ole a 
	formidable opponent.

real-world corba applications



pompeii, john.  "the design and construction of lisa."  dbms magazine
	 8, 13 (dec. 1995), 68-82.

	this is a case study of a real-world property management system that 
	is completely object-oriented.  it was built with ibm's distributed 
	systems object model (dsom), a corba-compliant framework, and runs on 
	a heterogeneous tcp/ip network with over 60 oracle7 database servers.  
	the fruits of omg and the object database management group (odmg) 
	are impressively displayed by the variety of dsom services (hence 
	corbaservices) utilized: naming service, persistence, event 
	notification, concurrency control, and more.  


almasi, g., et al.  web* -- a technology to make information available on the 
	web."  in proceedings of the fourth workshop on enabling 
	technologies: infrastructure for collaborative enterprises (wet ice 
	'95) (apr. 20-22, 1995, berkeley springs, west virginia).  ieee 
	computer society press, los alamitos, ca, pp. 147-153.

	web* is an enhanced common gateway interface (cgi) script that 
	includes a tcl-based orbix dynamic invocation interface (dii), allowing
	it to act as an orbix client to corba-compliant servers.  the authors 
	briefly describe the use of the static interface definition language 
	(idl) versus dii in web*.  although corba is not the major focus of 
	the paper, nevertheless, web* is a freely available working example 
	of a corba client.  the authors also mention a may 1995 trial of web* 
	for dynamic generation of medical patient records using an orbix 
	interface to oracle databases.

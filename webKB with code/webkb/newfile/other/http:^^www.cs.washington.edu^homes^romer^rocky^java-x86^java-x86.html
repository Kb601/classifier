java measurements on x86


java measurements on x86

this page contains a set of measurements of sun's java 1.0 interpreter
executing on a pentium pro running windows nt.  we had originally
measured java on the x86 platform because no java interpreter was yet
available for the alpha platform.  for consistency in the asplos vii
paper, we switched to the alpha when a java port became available.
but since we have the x86 measurements, we would also like to make
them available to those who are interested.  if you are interested
in the tool that we used to help collect these measurements on the x86,
take a look at the etch home page.  

the tables and figures below roughly correspond to the tables and
figures that appeared in the final version of the asplos vii paper.
however, since they are the tables and figures that were in the
submitted version of the paper, they are presented in a slightly
different format from the final version.  

the system on which we performed our measurements was a 150 mhz
pentium pro workstation running windows nt 3.51.  the c
microbenchmarks and the java interpreter were compiled using microsoft
visual c++ 4.0.  also note that, even though the java measurements
were from an x86 system, the measurements for the other interpreters
are still from the alpha system. 



 

table 1:  microbenchmark results.  this table shows the
slowdown of each microbenchmark relative to the equivalent operation
implemented in c.  each microbenchmark ran for at least five seconds
per trial.  each number presented is the average of 20 runs.  standard
deviations were no more than 10\% and were usually under 5%. 



 

table 2:  this table shows baseline performance measurements of
the interpreters running a set of representative programs, along with
two benchmark programs written in c.  the % fetch/decode column shows
the percentage of native instructions due to fetching and decoding
virtual commands.  native instructions per virtual command is simply
the total number of instructions executed divided by the number of
virtual commands. it includes fetch/decode overhead, as well as any
other program overheads. 



  

figures 1 and 2:  (these two figures from the final paper were
compiled from the data shown in these six graphs.)  java native
instruction count distributions for categories of java virtual
commands.  each category represents the total number of native
instructions executed while interpreting virtual commands in that
category during the execution phase.  successive categories are
cumulative with respect to previous categories.  the percentage after
each category name denotes the number of times that virtual commands
in that category were executed as a percentage of all virtual commands
executed.



figures 3 and 4

we do not have any corresponding results for figure 3 because we don't
have a pentium pro simulator with which to perform the equivalent
experiment.  similarly, we did not perform any cache simulations on
java executing on the x86.

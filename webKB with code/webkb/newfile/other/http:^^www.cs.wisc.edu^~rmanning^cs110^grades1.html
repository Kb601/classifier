grades for lecture 13




well, here they are, the grades for lecture 13.  i was very happy with
the effort everyone put in on the programs, and i hope you're enjoying
the extra time you have now!  grades are listed by the last 4 digits
of your student id number as given on my class list, although there
wasn't much need to separate them.  program 4 and other unreturned
homeworks are in a box on my desk in my office. 

if you want, click here
to give me some feedback!  i'd especially like
to know whether program 4 was too hard, or whether it was worth the
extra time to do.

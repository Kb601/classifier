cse 590 zp: course syllabus







the last four weeks of the quarter will be devoted to presentations by
class participants.  they will describe the scientific computation
that they are working on -- ideally, this discussion focuses on a
terrific zpl solution, but more realistically, it will focus on the
problem and how to progress towards a solution.



we will reschedule the 11/27 class due.  stay tuned for more details.

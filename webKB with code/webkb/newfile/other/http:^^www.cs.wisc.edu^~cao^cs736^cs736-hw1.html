 cs 736 assignment #1 (spring 96)

here is an informal description of assignment #1.

step 1: 
download lmbench from here; 
unpack it, /bin/sh each part;
build the benchmark and run it, get results; 

step 2: 
read the benchmark source and documents;

step 3: 
build and run lmbench on a different operating system;

step 4: 
write your own routine measuring the following:

how long does it take to do an integer add op?  (doesn't have
   to be complicated; you can ignore pipeline or other hardware details.)
how long does a null procedure call take?  vary the number of arguments passed;
measure system call latency using three different system calls other than write;
measure context switch overhead using semaphores, instead of pipes;
measure signal handling cost (hint. you can use mprotect);
measure page fault handling cost for zero-filled pages, instead of mmaped pages;
measure file open/close, creation/deletion latency in directories containing
	16, 64, 256 and 1024 files, on local file systems and afs or nfs file
	systems;
measure the latency of file read/write using different approaches:
	. unix read/write system call;
	. stream io library (i.e. stdio);
	. mmap;
   vary the size of each read/write.

write a simulator for memory server using tcp/ip and udp/ip, in which the
	the client send a request asking for certain buffer page, and the
	server respond by sending out a page.  measure the latency of such
	operations, for page sizes of 4k, 8k and 32k bytes.
with two or more clients simultaneously asking for service from the
    simulated memory server, measure the average response time of page requests.


step 5:
read the log-structured file system paper (rosenblum & ousterhout), 
section 5.1, reproduce the microbenchmark results on sun os.

bonus points:
measure anythings that interests you, and report your results.



what to submit:
a brief description of what you measured, and how you did it;
a list of your results; use graphs when appropriate;
the benchmark routines, with a makefile showing how to build and run them.

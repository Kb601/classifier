family history

opal is a descendant of a number of object-oriented distributed
systems built at uw during the 1980s.  following are some
references to some of those systems. 



 e. jul, h. levy, n. hutchinson, a. black.  
fine-grained mobility in the emerald
system. acm trans. on computer systems 6(1), february 1988.
(emerald is a distributed object-oriented language and system supporting
a single, logical, distributed, object address space.  it was the first
system with on-the-fly object mobility.  protection is guaranteed by 
the language and compiler.)


 j. chase, f. amador, e. lazowska, h. levy, r. littlefield.
the amber system: parallel programming on a network
of multiprocessors. proc. of the 12th acm symp. on operating
systems principles, december 1989. (amber is a distributed object-oriented
system, based on c++, for writing parallel programs that execute on 
a local-area network;  amber uses a single shared distributed address 
space above which c++ objects are supported.)

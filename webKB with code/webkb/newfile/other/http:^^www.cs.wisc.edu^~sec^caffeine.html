by means of comparison, a 7 oz cup of coffee has the following caffeine (mg)
amounts, according to bunker and mcwilliams in _j am diet_ 74:28-32, 1979:

drip                    115-175
brewed                  80-135
instant                 65-100
decaf                   3-4

in chem 120 we extracted at least 5 grams of caffeine from tea.  we used a
regular tea bag - my guess is orange peckoe.   quote from the lab manual:
caffeine is present in tea leaves and in coffee to the extent of about 4%.
tea also contains two other alkaloids, theobromine and theophilline.
these last two relax the smooth muscles where caffeine stimulates the
heart and respiratory systems.

other data on caffeine:

cup of coffee    90-150mg
instant coffee   60-80mg
canada dry diet cola    1.2

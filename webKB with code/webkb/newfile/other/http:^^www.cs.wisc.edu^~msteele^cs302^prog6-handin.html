program 6 handin dates


 
i'm extending the deadline for program 6 only.  

reasons:

     to be fair to people since i just made that last minute 
      correction and clarifications in e-mail
     because this project is taking people longer than i expected
      and most other ta's gave their classes a week and a half to
      do it instead of a week
     because it's midterm time, half of you are probably going to
      hand it in late anyway, and i'm feeling generous


the new policy for this program only is:

     you may hand it in by 5pm friday for 2 bonus points.
     you may hand it in by the end of my office hours on monday, 
      november 11 (2:30pm), for full credit.
     you may hand it in by the beginning of class on tuesday for
      the regular 25% reduction and by thursday for the regular 50%
      reduction.


so what's the catch?

     if you hand it in after friday, you should not expect to get it 
      graded and returned before the exam
     remember that the exam on tuesday counts 20% of your grade, whereas
      this program only counts approximately 4%.  do the math and budget
      your time this weekend accordingly.
     i'm going to be extraordinarily strict about deadlines this time.
      if you hand it in at 5:05pm on friday, no bonus points.  if you
      slide it under my door at 2:35pm on monday, it's late.

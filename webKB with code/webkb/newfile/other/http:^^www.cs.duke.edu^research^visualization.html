generalized swift-hohenberg eqaution
mpeg movie: approximately 3m in size.

this movie was produced by students of henry greenside. 
the movie is a numerical simulation of
so-called spiral chaos, a novel dynamical state discovered in
convection experiments last year. the simulation is not of the full
fluid equations but of a simplified model of convection and transition
to turbulence near onset known as the generalized swift-hohenberg
equation. the calculation is in a square periodic domain of size 32pi
by 32pi and was started from random initial conditions of low
amplitude. the movie encompasses ten horizontal diffusion times.

vrml introduction


progressive vrml

in our progressive vrml paper, we identify a key shortcoming of vrml,
the lack of a guarantee that vrml scenes are progressive.  we propose
a solution that transforms an arbitrary vrml scene into a progressive
one. we employ a technique known as hierarchical uniform grids to
achieve this goal.  the progressive structure generated by this
algorithm reflects the semantics of objects within the scene, which
allows for generalization and refinement.  our approach adds a
processing step at scene creation time, but does not require any vrml
client modification.

program description

you have been hired as a golf pro at the big shank country club.
big shank actually consists of 5 different 9-hole golf courses, each of
which has a separate "par" score.  

(notes for people unfamiliar with golf: the object of golf is to
obtain as low a score as possible.  your score for each hole is the
total number of shots it takes to get the golf ball in the hole.  your
score for the entire round is the sum of your scores for each holes.
"par" for a hole is generally the score that a good golfer would
receive on that hole, and par for the entire course is the sum of the
pars for each individual hole.  golfers try to get a score lower than
par for the course.  for example, each hole in a 9 hole course would
have a par score.  if par for each hole was 4, then par for the entire
course would be 36.  if a golfer scored 3 on each hole on that course,
the golfer would have a score of 27, which is very good, since it is
less than, or "under" par.  in fact, since 27 - 36 = -9, we say the
golfer is 9 under par.  if, on the other hand, a golfer scored 5 on
each hole, the golfer would have a score of 45, and would be 9 over par, which
is not as good.  note that 45 - 36 = 9.)

you have been assigned to work at a golf tournament 
being held at big shank.  a number of players are each playing
one round on each course.  thus, each player will have 
a different score for each of the 5 courses. in addition,
each of the five 9-hole courses at big shank has a  different 
par score.  all of this data will be stored into an input file.
the file will have the following form:

 
36 35 36 33 32 
124 37 33 35 37 35 
2353 37 35 34 32 33 
3457 40 31 32 35 28 
532 32 35 34 34 30 
-1




the first line lists the par score for each of the 5 courses.
thus, par for the first course is 36, par for the second is 35,
and so on.

the next 4 lines list the scores for each
individual golfer on each course.  the first part of each 
of these lines is the "golfer id" number, which you may assume
fits into an int.  you may also assume
that each id number is unique. 
the remaining 5 numbers hold that golfer's
score for each of the 5 courses.  thus, the first golfer has
an id of 4343, and has scores of 37, 33, 35, 37, and 35.


finally, a -1 is included in the file, which means that 
the listing of scores is now complete.  when you read in a
-1 instead of a positive id, you can assume all the players have
been listed.  (if there is any input data after the -1, you can 
ignore it).

note: the data in the actual input files will be different than
the data given above.  thus, you may not assume anything about
the number of golfers, the par scores for the 5 rounds, and so on.    


also, the input file may have a different spacing and line breaks
than the one listed above.  for example, the above data
could be present in the input file in the following form:

 
36 
35      36  33       
32 
124 37 33 

35 37 35 
2353 37       35 34 32 
33 
3457    40 31 32 35 28 
532 

32 
35 34 34 30 
-1



note that the data is the same, the only difference is that
the spacing and line breaks have changed.

your job is to:
 determine the score for each golfer - that is, the
golfer's score relative to the par score.  scores over par 
should be output with positive numbers, scores below par
should be output with negative numbers, and an "even par" score
should be output as 0.
 determine the average score for each course, and the 
average par score for all golfers.
 determine who won the tournament and what the winning
score was.  the winner of the tournament is that person
with the lowest overall score relative to par.  you may assume
that there is a unique lowest score - that is, that there
will not be multiple winners with the same lowest score. 
 print all of this information neatly to an output file. 

here is how your output file should appear for the sample data
given above:


 player id   round 1   round 2   round 3   round 4   round 5 final par
       par        36        35        36        33        32         -

       124        37        33        35        37        35         5
      2353        37        35        34        32        33        -1
      3457        40        31        32        35        28        -6
       532        32        35        34        34        30        -7

     average     36.50     33.50     33.75     34.50     31.50     -2.25

the winner is player #532 with a score of 7 under par.



the second line, which begins with par, lists the par score
for each of the 5 rounds. 

the following
4 lines list data for each individual golfer.  first,
the golfer's id is displayed.  next, the golfer's scores
on each of the courses is displayed.  finally, the golfer's overall "par"
score is displayed, in the final par column.

for example, the golfer with the id 124 scored 37, 33, 35, 37, and
35, on rounds 1-5 respectively.  thus, these scores are listed in the 
5 "round" columns.  the sum of these scores (177) is 5 more than
the sum of the par scores for the 5 courses (172).  thus, a 5 is displayed
for golfer 124 in the final par column, where 5 means "5 over par." 

the next golfer, with an id of 2353, scored 37, 35, 34, 32, and 33 in the
5 rounds.  thus, that golfer's total score (171), is one  less  than the 
par score, so a -1 is recorded as the golfer's final par, signaling 1 under par.

the scores for the remaining 2 golfers are then printed out, as well as their
final scores (6 and 7 under par).

the line beginning with average  lists the average 
total score for each of the 5 courses.  for example, since the 
average of 37, 37, 40, and 32 is 36.5, 36.50 is printed as the average
for round 1.  the remaining averages for the other 4 rounds are
printed out.  finally, the average tournament par score for all
golfers is printed out. 

the final line displays the id of the golfer who won
as well as that golfer's score relative to par. 


note that to receive full credit on this assignment, you must format
your output file in  exactly  the same way as the sample above.
for example, each column should be 10 characters wide, and the averages
should be displayed with 2 trailing decimal points. 


we have provided a test input file for you to use, which
is called "golfin.txt".  you may find it in the r:\public\program4 
directory.
please note that i may use a different input file
when testing your program, but it will have the same name
and will be formatted in the same
way as golfin.txt and the example given above.   you should also
be sure to make up your own input files to use to test your program as well.

you should name the output file produced by your program
"golfout.txt." 

your solution should use functions where appropriate, but you may not use global
variables.  you should check to make sure the file was opened correctly.
you need not do any error checking when you read in the data from 
the file  except  for the following: if one of the input
scores is  smaller  than the number of holes (9), which is of 
course impossible, your program should penalize that cheater
by changing the score on that round to 200.

your program should print out the following
statements to the screen:


beginning file processing....
done with file processing.  output file written.




 what to turn in 

once you have your program working, you should use the test file
provided, "golfin.txt", as your input file.  then, print out a copy of
the "golfout.txt" file your program produces.  repeat this for your
own test data. (including the printout) also print out a copy of
the c++ source code and submit an electronic copy of your source code
and executable as described in the project 1 directions.

paper assignment #1
(due: wednesday, september 25)



description
the goal of this assignment is to think about and describe the memory
management facility of a new and powerful computer.
you will use the ideas that you have read about, and apply these to a
different environment.

the computer that you are thinking about will have some
interesting characteristics.
first, it will be a multiprocessor, with 1-16 cpu's.
there will be many cpu's sharing the same memory (see figure below).
this computer will support parallel programs consisting of many processes
cooperating in a single computation.
parallel programs will share memory to communicate and use a mechanism such
as semaphores, spin-locks, or monitors to synchronize.
second, it will have a large physical memory.
it will be common to see machines with 256 megabytes (or more) of ram, with
4-16 kb page frames.
these large memories will be useful in supporting applications in ai, graphics,
vision, cad, and databases.

remember:
large page frames and physical memory
and
lots of sharing.

you are to describe how the working set concept can help to efficiently
allocate the memory and cpu's in this workstation design.
there are two areas that you will address.
first, how can you use the concept of working set to efficiently execute
parallel programs.
for example, we might have a simple producer/consumer pair of processes.
how can we schedule the cpu's and memory to make this program execute well?
what about more complex computations made up of many processes?
what about the competition between several parallel programs for resources?
how do we define resource demand and balance set?
how do you define the last referenced time for a page shared by many
processes?

second, how does the large address space affect resource scheduling?
is memory scheduling a dead issue?
do applications with extremely large memory demands change the way we allocate
memory?
what about the cost of gathering scheduling information and storing tables?

you paper will make design decisions that may require data about the type of
programs that will run on the workstation and how these programs will behave.
you should describe what information you need and
how you will go about collecting the information to
make these design decisions.
you should also describe how you will verify these decisions and how you will
set the parameters of the various policies that you design.

as you are thinking about your design, you should think about the
goal and features of previous systems.
which of these goals are no longer important?
what are the significant differences of this new computer from ones that we
have read about?
you will, of course, want to consider what goals are still important.
can you use solutions from the past or will you satisfy these goals in new
ways?







constraints

the paper should be at most 6 pages, 10 point font, double-spaced,
single-sided and 1 inch margins.
the paper must contain the following parts:

title:

the title should be descriptive and fit in one line across the page.
interesting titles are acceptable, but avoid overly cute ones.
abstract:

this is the paper in brief.
it is 
not
a description of the paper.
it should state the basic contents and conclusions of the paper.
it is an advertisement that will draw the reader to your paper, without
being misleading.
it should be complete enough to understand what will be covered in the paper.
avoid phrases such as "the paper describes...."
this is a technical paper and not a mystery novel; don't be afraid of giving
away the ending.
body:

this is the main part of the paper.
it should include an introduction that prepares the reader for the
remainder of the paper.
assume that the reader is knowledgeable about working set and operating
systems.
the introduction should motivate the rest of the discussion and outline
the approach.
the main part of the paper should be split into reasonable sections.
the last part of the body is the conclusion.
this is a discussion of what the reader should have learned from the
paper.
you can repeat things stated earlier in the paper, but only to the extent
that they contribute to the final discussion.
references:

you must cite each paper that you have referenced.
this section appears at the end of the paper.
figures:

a paper without figures, graphs, or diagrams is boring.
a rule of thumb is one figure for each 3 or 4 pages.
these figures should (typically) take up only a small portion of
a page.
your paper must have figures.


do not redescribe the assignment; address the issues described above.
the paper must be written using correct english  grammar.
there should be no spelling mistakes.
a paper that is difficult to read or has poor grammar
will be returned ungraded.
remember the word of the day: pithy.

project information


what to turn in for the proposal

project proposals are due on monday, march 11, 
but i'd be happy to look at them before then.

the project proposal should contain a short description of:


 the topic/problem in which you're interested
 the papers that you'll read (if you're doing a "reading" project)
 a description of the general approach you plan to use to solve the problem
 (if you're doing a "programming" project)
 plan for evaluation of the theory/technique (for both types of project)






what to turn in for the project

official due date: friday 5/3.  we'll accept projects without penalty
until 5:00, friday 5/10.

programming projects:

final writeup for programming projects (just a few pages):

    problem description
    description of general approach
    description and results of evaluation
    discussion. (what worked; what didn't work; options you'd
	like to have tried; analysis of the results; etc.)
    i'd also like to see any code that you wrote and a few short
	traces of the system in action (if that makes sense for your project).




in-class presentation: ~7 minutes in length. should include
an overview of the problem; your solution; evaluation method and
results. 



non-programming projects:

final writeup for non-programming projects. this will vary for
each person, but in general, the final writeup for non-programming
projects will probably contain a description of the problem that you
looked at; a summary of the papers that you read; a critique of the
existing approaches; your attempt at an evaluation of the the
theory/algorithms presented in the papers on real text.



in-class presentation: for non-programming projects, the
in-class presentation should be a synopsis of what you'll include in
the paper.  you'll have to leave a lot out of course...





programming projects from last year's class

grammar induction using genetic algorithms
this project implements a grammar generator using genetic algorithms.

autoslog and falcon:  automated lexicon construction
this paper evaluates the performance of autoslog and falcon as lexicon
constructors.

a preposition attacher
this project uses a matching algorithm for preposition attachment.

statistical word sense disambiguation
this project implements a number of related statistical methods for word-sense
disambiguation and evaluates the method using examples from the brown corpus.

automated english-esperanto translation
this project implements a limited english-esperanto translator by extending
james allen's bottom-up parser.

an implementation of a method for word sense disambiguation
this project implements a relaxation network approach (like circus's) for word-sense
disambiguation. it is based on: large neural networks
for the resolution of lexical ambiguity by j. veronis and n. ide.

the viterbi algorithm and smoothing
this project is an implementation of a part-of-speech tagger using a hidden
markov model, a smoothed bigram language model, and the viterbi algorithm.


reading projects from last year's class

topics in intelligent multimedia/multimodal interface
this paper examines two existing systems that incorporate intelligent
multimedia/multinodal interfaces (wip and comet).
using foil for wh-phrase disambiguation
this paper examines ways to use foil for  wh-phrase disambiguation.  (foil is a
supervised learning algorithm for acquiring concepts in first-order logic.)
natural language understanding of the japanese language
this paper summarizes issues for understanding japanese.
approaches to automated question answering
this paper addresses issues in understanding and replying to questions given
in english.
word boundary detection in continuous speech recognition: application of
phonological constraints 
this paper looks at three models that use broad class, phonemic sequence, and 
allophonic constraints to facilitate word boundary detection.
computer understanding of conventional metaphoric language
this paper looks at midas (metaphor interpretation, denotation and acquisition system)
for understanding conventional metaphor. 
an analysis of transformation-based part of speech tagging
this paper critiques the an article on transformation-based
part of speech tagging.
neural networks and nlu
this paper looks at neural network applications for natural language understanding.
pronominal anaphora resolution
this paper describes four approaches to the computational task of resolving
the pronoun referents.
harmonic grammars and unaccusativity
this paper looks at harmonic grammars developed by smolensky, legendre and
miyata.

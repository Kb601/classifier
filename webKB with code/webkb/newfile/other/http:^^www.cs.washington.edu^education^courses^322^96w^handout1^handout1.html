construction of regular grammars from regular expressions



for the purposes of this construction we use regular grammars
which have productions of the form  and 
.
to generate the the empty language no productions are needed.
to generate the singleton language  just use the two
productions  and .

for the recursive part of the construction,
let  and
 be regular
grammars which generate the languages defined by the regular
expression  and , respectively.  we will assume
that .  given the regular 
expression  which is built from the regular expressions
 and  we define a new regular grammar 
 which
generates the language defined by .
there are three cases to consider:

case 1.  .  let  be a new
non-terminal. 
  is the start symbol of .

.

.


case 2.  . 
 .

.

 and
.


case 3.  . let  be a new
non-terminal. 
  is the start symbol for .

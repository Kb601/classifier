abstract:
this report describes the implementation of a new parallel algorithm
for finding clusters point sets of euclidean space.
a new solution to a special case of the  bichromatic closest pairs
problem is used by the algorithm.
the implementation was done in an environment
for distributed tree computations on the kendall square research ksr-2
multiprocessor.

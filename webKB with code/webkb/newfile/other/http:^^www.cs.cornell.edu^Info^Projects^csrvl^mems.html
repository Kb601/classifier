distributed manipulation and micro-electro mechanical systems (mems)





description  

recently, graduate student jim jennings, research associate  daniela
rus, graduate student 
russell brown,							

 
professor bruce donald, 

 and lab alumnus  jonathan rees
(now at mit), developed a  team of autonomous
mobile robots that can perform sophisticated  distributed manipulation tasks
(such as  moving furniture).  the robots run
robust spmd protocols that are completely asynchronous and require no
communication. grad student  karl
b&ouml;hringer,  
professor bruce donald, 
 and ee professor noel macdonald, are building a 
massively parallel array of microactuators in the cornell national
nanofabrication laboratory.  the array
is a scream chip containing over 11,000 actuators in 1 square
centemeter, and can orient small parts without sensory
feedback. our microfabricated actuator arrays could be used to
construct programmable parts-feeders (at any scale), or to build
self-propelled ic's (walking vlsi chips.)

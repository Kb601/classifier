 course description 

this course provides an introduction to the techniques of producing
and manipulating pictures interactively on computers equipped with
appropriate hardware.  the evolution and characteristics of the
hardware of graphics displays and input devices is covered.  software
techniques for rendering geometric primitives such as points, lines,
and curves on such hardware, as well as algorithms for organizing the
display of pictures composed of these primitives is taught.  basic
algorithms for transformation and clipping in both two-dimensional and
three-dimensional environments are covered, along with orthographic
and perspective projection techniques.  the architecture of device
independent graphics software packages for both two and three
dimensional applications is covered, and techniques for the
organization of graphical databases are emphasized.  graphical input
processing is covered as an integral part of these software issues.
brief discussions of advanced topics including hidden line and surface
removal, advanced modeling and rendering techniques, and high
performance architectures are also included.



the course involves a significant amount of programming, with the
basic techniques covered in the course being incorporated into a
series of programming assignments.  the programming assignments for
the course will be done on the cs department's public unix
workstations unless other arrangements are made.  these machines all
support the the xwindows environment, the mesa opengl-like 3-d
graphics library, the tcl/tk command language and widget libraries for
building user interfaces, and the tiger opengl extension to tcl/tk.
introductory documentation on these software tools will be made
available.  complete documentation for xwindows, opengl, and tcl/tk
can be purchased from local bookstores.  arrangements for the use of
alternate computing environments can be discussed with the instructor.

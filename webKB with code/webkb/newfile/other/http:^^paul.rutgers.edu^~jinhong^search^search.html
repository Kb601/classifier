parallel internet search engine



parallel internet search engine


the idea is to send your query to a server a first, then server a sends
the query to alta vista, lycos, yahoo and webcrawler at the same time.
then whichever of the 4 engine response the first, the result will be sent
to you first, with all the others follow.
the good news is that you'll have fast response time. espiecially when
one of the search engine is busy and you have to wait for the result without
knowing it if you just use normal single search engine.
the tradeoff is that you'll have to spend some time in communication with
the server a. but you can have the server installed in your own machine.


below is a parallel search test, sorry if the server(server a) not responce
because i cannot let it running all the time.
my server a is a java application using thread.

research and academic interests



i am a graduate student in the area of  programming languages  in
the  department of computer science 
at the  university of wisconsin-madison .


i am a research assistant for  professor tom reps . our
research group,  the wisconsin
program slicing project, aims to create enhanced tools to support the
development of complex software systems. my research is directed (at least
for today) towards using types and type inference to improve software
reusability.

papers and publications:

   

siff, m. and reps, t.,
program generalization for software reuse: from c to c++,
tr-1315, computer sciences department, university of wisconsin,
madison, wi, may 1996.

to appear in acm sigsoft '96 fourth symposium on the foundations of
software engineering.





my main academic interests lie in the application of insights and
techniques of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science to solve
problems in programming languages and compiler design.

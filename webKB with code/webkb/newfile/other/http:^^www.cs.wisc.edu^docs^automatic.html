automaticly indexed documents



automatically indexed documents

the web server runs a script three times a day to check for html files with
special names in people's home directories.  if these files exist, they are
linked into master lists for easy accessibility.  the auto-indexed pages
currently include:


   ``home'' or ``signature'' pages
   classes pages


``home'' or ``signature'' pages

directories of computer sciences
faculty and research staff,
graduate students, and
undergraduate majors are 
automatically generated. links to home pages are included for
every file with the name 
~username/public/html/username.html in the 
afs filesystem.  (this isn't true
yet.  currently only those accounts that fit into the above lists are
indexed.  we will be adding a catch-all ``other'' list soon.)

remember that our server translates ~username to 
~username/public/html, so the url for user joe's homepage, 
for example, would be http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~joe/joe.html, even 
though it is stored in the filesystem at ~joe/public/html/joe.html.


class pages

pages for classes are looked for 
in two places.  the first is any file
matching the pattern ~cs(course_number)-(section)/public/html/cs(course_number).html.  the second is any with the same name,
but in the course instructor's account instead of the course account.  the
second form is the only one available to cs302 instructors.

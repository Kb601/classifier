the raw trace is at: ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/people/pc/ultrix-traces.tar.z 

enclosed here are the i/o traces i collected from a number of applications, and
the program that parses them and prints out the records.  the applications
are:

dinero (j1-trace): trace-driven cache simulator.  
	access pattern: the trace file is read sequentially multiple times;
cscope1 (j2-trace): cscope searching symbol names in a large kernel source;
	access pattern: the database file is read sequentially multiple
		times;
cscope2 (j4-trace): cscope searching text strings in a large kernel source;
	access pattern: collection of multiple source-code files read in
		the same order sequentially multiple times; 
cscope3 (j3-trace): cscope searching text strings in a small kernel source;
	access pattern: collection of multiple source-code files read in
		the same order sequentially multiple times;
	* the difference between cscope2 and cscope3 is that cscope2's data
		set is larger than cscope3's.  
glimpse (j5-trace): searching for key words among a collection of text files;
	access pattern: there is two sets of files, index files and data
		files.  index files are much smaller than the collection of
		data files.  index files are read sequentially multiple times,
		and based on the result of searching the indices, some groups
		of data files are read.  each group of data files are always 
		read sequentially in the same order every time.

ld (j6-trace): link-editing the kernel.  
	access pattern: random accesses, including both read and write; no 
		reuse of data, but since the size of a read request is not 
		always 8k, there are reuse at the block level (a block is
		8k bytes and is often the granularity of caching).

postgres1 (pq7-trace): postgres doing selection, there is an index available;
	access pattern: the index is searched first, then selected tuples are
		read; moderate reuse of file blocks due to one block holding 
		multiple tuples;
postgres2 (pjoin-trace): postgres doing join, between an indexed inner 
		relation and a non-index outer relation.  
	access pattern: the outer relation is read sequentially once, and the 
		index of the inner relation is search repeatedly everytime a 
		tuple in the outer relation.

xdataslice (xds-trace): 3-d volume rendering software working on a 220x220x220
		data volume, rendering 22 slices with stride 10, along the 
		x axis, then y axis, then z axis.
	access pattern: access blocks in a file with regular strides, no reuse
		when rendering along one axis, but moderate reuse between the
		rendering along different axises.

sort (bigsort-trace): unix external sorting utility, sorting a 200,000 line
		17mb tex file.
	access pattern: first segment the file into small files that are
		sorted in memory and wrote out to temporary file, then
		temporary files are merge sorted into the final sorted file.
		both read and write intensive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

the events that are traced all come with a time stamp, which is the ``time''
field in ``struct tracerecord'' (see ``iotrace.h'').  the time field is
actually the value of a counter that goes at 25mhz (40ns granularity); thus
it is an unsigned 32-bit int, and wraps around every 171.8 seconds (is that
right?).  

the ``op'' field in ``struct tracerecord'' is the event identifier of the
record.  its possible values are listed in ``iotrace.h''.  

the events traced fall in two categories:

. system calls: almost all file system related syscalls, see the listing in
	``iotrace.h'' for the value of tracerecord.op between 1 and 21.

. kernel i/o events:
	mytrace_rwend: the kernel finished the processing of a ``read'' or
			``write'' system call;
		(so the time between the ``read'' or ``write'' system call
		and the mytrace_rwend event is the time it took the kernel
		to process this call.)

	mytrace_rdbegin and mytrace_rdbegin2: 
		a disk read request is issued to the disk;
		(the flags are different because they are issued in different
		routines, mytrace_rdbegin in bread and mytrace_rdbegin2 in 
		breada);
	mytrace_rdend and mytrace_rdend2: the read request issued in
		mytrace_rdbegin or mytrace_rdbegin2 has just finished;

	mytrace_rardbegin: ultrix has a one-block-lookahead prefetching 
		algorithm; that is, if block k of file a is read, and the 
		kernel see that the last read to file a is to block k-1, then
		the kernel prefetches block k+1.  this prefetch 
		(or ``readahead'') is recorded by mytrace_rardbegin;

	mytrace_busyend: if a ``read'' or ``write'' system call finds that 
		the block it wants to read is marked ``busy'', that is, an i/o 
		is currently in progress for this block, then it waits till 
		the busy bit is turned off.  this happens, for example, when 
		a readahead was issued for this block in the previous read 
		system call.
		mytrace_busyend record the time when the busy bit on the block
		is cleared and the process can read or write the block.

	mytrace_bwrbegin: a disk write request is issued; note that although
		user processes always wait for the read request, they don't
		necessary wait for the write request.  most of the time the
		write request is asynchronous.
	mytrace_bwrend: if the above write request is synchronous, then this
		event record the time when it finishes;

. detailed kernel activities: only some traces recorded these detailed events;
	that is, don't be bothered if they don't show up in a particular
	trace; (actually, i think they show up in any of the traces i put here;
	my tracing utility evolve over time...)

	mytrace_biodone: a disk i/o request is finished;

	mytrace_rdbegin_inbread: a disk read request is issued in the ``bread''
		routine in ufs code;
	mytrace_rdend_inbread: the time when that request is finished;
	(mytrace_rdbegin_inbread and mytrace_rdend_inbread should always
		appear in pairs)

	mytrace_rdbegin_inbrda: a disk read request is issued in the ``breada''
		routine in ufs code;
	mytrace_rdend_inbrda: time when this request has finished;
	mytrace_rdnext_inbrda: a readahead request is issued in ``breada'';
	
	mytrace_busywait: a ``read'' or ``write'' system call finds that
		the block it needs to access is busy, so it is about to
		sleep to wait for the busy bit to be cleared; mytrace_busywait
		records when this happens;

	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the structure of the trace record is the following:

pid: pid of the user process;
op:  event identifier;
i_num:	inode number of the file accessed;
i_dev:  device number of the file accessed;
offset: offset in file of the read or write request;
count:  size of the read or write request;
time:   40ns clock counter;

note: 
. i_num is only meaningful for the system call events; you should ignore the 
	i_num field for all other events; 
. i_dev is meaningful for most events; it records the dev number of the device 
	to which the i/o is issued;
. offset and count are only meaningful for ``read'' and ``write'' system calls;
	ignore them for all other events;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

source files:

. iotrace.h: header file for the trace records and event identifiers;
	rec_trace is the macro the kernel source uses to record an event;

. readtrace.c: prints out each record in the raw trace file in a human-readable
	form;

. readrec.c: a library routine for my simulator; it reads the tracerecords 
	from a trace files and return a generic record to be used by my
	simulator; it ignores the kernel events; (it may not be that useful 
	to you.)
. record.h: the header file for the generic record type used in my simulator;

 cs/che 838-3
translated appbt, one of the nas parallel benchmarks, from fortran
to c and parallelized it for use on a shared-memory multiprocessor.
it was ported to the wisconsin wind tunnel for use as a research
benchmark.
 cs/ece 757
studied the effect of limited broadcast cache-coherence protocols
on invalidation traffic in highly parallel shared-memory multiprocessors.
our measurements were obtained with the wisconsin wind tunnel.
 cs/ece 755
designed jihad, a ~5500 transistor vlsi dram controller, to be used
in a proposed ramlink memory system.  the chip was fabricated and
underwent successful testing (i.e., it worked).
 cs/ece 752
designed and simulated (gate-level) cordic hardware to approximate
trigonometric functions in ieee floating point format.
 cs 747
developed a queueing model to represent a large-scale shared memory
multiprocessor, using homogenous processing nodes and a constant delay
model.
 cs 736
modified the wisconsin wind tunnel to support simulation of virtual
memory and demand paging, to study paging behavior of parallel
scientific codes on shared-memory multiprocessors. 
 cs 701
wrote a compiler for ada/cs, a subset of the ada programming language.
the target assembler code was a variant of mips.
cs/ece 552
designed and simulated (gate-level) a simple risc cpu in the 
galaxy programming environment.

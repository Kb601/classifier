secret life of yas saito





secret life of yasushi saito


i was in japan before coming to
seattle.  i was born in a small village in
shikoku island. i lived
in kyoto, dallas(tx), osaka, and tokyo then.
i graduated department of information
science at university of
tokyo (bs '90, ms '92). my mentor was ken sakamura. in bs study, i
remember
having mucked around a prototype computer
called btron1 and written a gui
language that vaguely resembled stk.  and believe me, i did ms study
in theory field(about developing a formal specification of an embedded
os and verifying an implementation i wrote).


i had been working from '92 to '94 at access ltd, a small software
company in tokyo that was even not internet-reachable(and still not now).
i tried to
create a nfs server on pc from scratch, but i quit the company just
before it completed. also, i was in charge of overall lan management.
this was where i gained lots of unix experience.

between '94 and '95, i was kind of jobless. i some times worked as a
parttime programmer at some companies and universities.

besides hacking, i swim(but not recently), scuba dive, run, bicycle and ski.
i'm also a travelling addict. i visited thai this spring but this caused
among some people a suspicion that i don't understand :).
i traveled across central american countries
from guatemala to costa rica this summer('96).

faq:

   what does "yasushi" mean?
       contrary to what many people believe, my name has nothing to do
       with sushi.
       yasushi writes "Ì÷" in japanese letter(if you are in netscape,
       choose options/document encoding/japanese (auto-detect) to see
       the the stuff inside "")
       
       it seems to mean "stability"  according to my parents.
       my father is muneyasu, and he gave the latter part of
       his name to me.
        you are free to call me yas if yasushi is too long.
   what does "saito" mean?
       this i don't know really. in kanji, "saito" consists of two letters
       "sai"(ºØ) and "to"(Æ£). "to" is the same letter as the first letter of
       "fujiwara"(Æ£¸¶) family, a famous aristocrat in medieval japan.
       and "sai" usually means "funeral" or something. so my guess is that
       "saito" family branched from fujiwara family and specialized in
       rituals.

contents of this page
we show here "mpeg" examples for the different categories of effects that we are designing



index

  2d effects
  3d effects
 warping / morphing 





2d effects
curtains

effects in this categorie make the transition dividing the original image 2d geometric shapes.  


 interlace 





 squares 





 smear 




 melting 




blocks 




disolve effects

effects that make a smooth transition between images.


 grain 





3d simulated effects

this effects simulate 3d effects using 2d techniques and "tricks" but they are not real 3d projections.


 peeling 




 folds1 




 folds2 




 strips1 




 strips2 






3d effects
forward mapping

the pixels in the original image are directly projected on the screen 
 cylinder 




 zoom 



 reverse mapping

we scan the proyection screen to find the projection of the pixels on the 3d shape 

 flip 




 fly 





warping / morphing
this is the last phase of the project, we will study transitions based on the distortion of images using warping techniques and fading. morphing is one of these advanced techniques 

 wobble 



amith has written a simple warping program......

 cs611:  semantics of programming languages

homeworks:

 homework 0 (dvi file)

 to solve this homework you need some ml definitions found in 
     (the misnamed) hw1defs.sml.
     the ml examples from class are also available in 
     examples.sml, as well as a 
     postscript version of the homework.
 there is now a solution online, as well
     as some tests.

 homework 1 (dvi file)

 the second homework.  this one features proofs as well as ml hacking.
     there is also a postscript version 
     of the assignment writeup.
 there is now an ml solution online, as well
     as solutions (dvi) to the proofs (also
     available in postscript).
 note: the test cases used to grade
     your solutions are also online.

 homework 2 (dvi file)

 the third homework.  proofs and ml hacking again, now with types!
     there is also a postscript version. 
 there is now a solution (dvi) to the proofs 
     online (also available in postscript).
 there is also an ml solution to the programming
     part online.
 finally there is a parser and evaluator based
     on the solution online.  the ml-lex and 
     ml-yacc parser source is available for those
     interested.

 homework 3 (dvi file)

 the fourth homework.  now it's only proofs, all exercises from gunter.
     there is also a postscript version. 
 there is now a solution (dvi) 
     online (also available in postscript).

 homework 4 (dvi file)

 the fifth homework.  implementing the polymorphic lambda calculus, and
     a lemma showing the soundness of the predicative model with respect to
     type-beta reduction.
 for those who don't want to type in the example code there is a 
     text-only version of the homework.
 there is now an ml solution online, as well
     as the test cases used to grade your
     submissions.
 there is now a proof solution (dvi) 
     online (also available in postscript).

 homework 5 (dvi file)

 the sixth homework.  implementations and proofs of unification and
     type inference.
     there is also a postscript version. 
 for those who don't want to type in the example code there is a 
     text-only version of the homework.
 the ml solution is online, as well
     as the test cases.
 the solution (dvi) to the proofs is
     online (also in postscript).

 homework 6 (dvi file)

 the seventh homework.  proofs on posets, cpos, continuous functions etc.
     there is also a postscript version. 

 assignment 0 (postscript)

 the eight homework.  programming exercises and axiomatic semantics 
     exercises and proofs.

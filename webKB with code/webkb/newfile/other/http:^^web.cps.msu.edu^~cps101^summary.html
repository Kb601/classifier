ccc: computing concepts and competencies
executive summary


        



the explosive growth of well designed, discipline-specific software mandates a
fundamental rethinking of the role of computing instruction in the curriculum
and of the role of the computer science department in delivering that 
instruction. 

        

we propose a new model based on joint determination of computing needs between
cps and "served" departments, embedding major-related examples into a new 
service course. (see "teaching of science, mathematics, engineering and 
technology in context: an institutional venue for reform," submitted over 
president mcpherson's signature to the nsf division of undergraduate  
education, 12/4/95.)

        

we will work both with faculty in cps and in the "served" departments to 
create ccc: computing concepts and competencies (cps101),  a 3(2-2), 
multi-section, service course in which the lecture component gives all
students a broad, conceptual overview of  both the concepts of computing 
and of the competencies needed to solve computer-related problems integral 
to their major fields of study.

        

the seamlessly integrated laboratory experience will consist of computing 
"focal problems" which epitomize core computing concepts and, in turn, 
exemplify the relevance of core computing competencies to the solution 
of those problems.



focal problems => computing concepts => computing competencies


                                    

working in partnership with faculty in the "served" departments, we will create
appropriate clusters of sections whose "competencies" content is tightly 
coupled to the needs of students in those clusters. those faculty will give 
much of the key "competencies" video-instruction for students in their 
clusters, while the cps department will provide the "concepts" instruction 
and the infrastructure to support the entire effort.

        

this course will replace both cps100 (using computers)  and cps130 (integrated
introduction to computing), beginning in fall, 1997, and will thereafter be
continuously revised to reflect changing instructional needs and computing
technologies. we expect a total, annual enrollment of about 5,000 students 
on campus plus an undetermined number of "distance education" students.

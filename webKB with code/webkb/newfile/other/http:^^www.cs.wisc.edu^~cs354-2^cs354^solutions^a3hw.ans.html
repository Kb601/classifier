total score:

(1) (4 points) find the largest ieee 32 bit
floating point number that does not have an integer value. express
the answer in binary and in decimal.

answer

all fps numbers larger than:
100000000000000000000000.02 = 223 have integer values
since
the significant only holds 23 bits
&nbsp;
the next smaller fps number is:
 11111111111111111111111.12 = 223 - 0.5 =
8388607.510


&nbsp;

(2) (2 points each, 6 points total) write
the hexadecimal values for x, y and z just after the following code
executes:

answer



move x, 0x0f0fc123
and  x, x, 0xff00f000      # x = 0x0f00c000
not  x, x                  # x = 0xf0ff3fff &lt;- ans
move y, 0x8f0aabc9
sll  y, y, 5               # y = 0xe1557920 &lt;- ans
nor  z, x, y               # z = 0x0e008000 &lt;- ans

(3) (3 points each, 6 points total) do the
following 2's complement multiplication. indicate if either
computation overflows for 12 bit words, for 6 bit words. show your
work. check your results by redoing the computation in
decimal.

          001010                                    001010            
        x 111100                                  x 000011

----------------                                  --------
1001111111011000 &lt;- 011000 is 2410                 0011110 &lt;-  011110 is 3010
                    in 6 bit, 2's comp                         in 6 bit, 2's comp
&nbsp;
111111011000 is -40 in 12 bit 2's comp,            no overflow in 12 or 6 bits
no overflow for 12 bit words but overflow
for 6 bit words

     

(4) (4 points) show that the following two
code segments give the same value for c, for any values of a and b.
hint: consider truth tables (see page 116 of the text).

and c, a, b          not c, a
not c                not d, b
                     or  c, c, d

answer

the first sequence is not(a and b)
while the second is (not(a) or not(b))
column 4 and 7 of the following truth table are the same
so not(a and b) is the same as not(a) or not(b)
&nbsp;
a     b    (a and b)  not(a and b)   not(a)   not(b)   (not(a) or not(b))
0     0        0           1           1        1              1

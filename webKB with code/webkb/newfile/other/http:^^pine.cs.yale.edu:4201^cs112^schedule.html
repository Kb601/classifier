      final exam.  the final will be a
        cumulative closed-book exam.  just like the midterm, but half
        again
        as long.  a sample final (with
        solutions) is
      available.

      11/13/96
      hash tables.  a hash table is a trick for speeding up access
      to the elements of a linked list by splitting the list into many
      separate lists (stored in an array).  to find out which list
        each element goes in, one uses a hash function that
      transforms each element into a consistent but random-looking
      number.  the effect is a bit like using a filing cabinet with
      many separate folders to store data instead of one big stack of
        paper.  see the demo program for an example.
          demos:
          
              hashtable.p

      drawn in class.  the compression was done on a unix machine
                using a program written in perl, which
      demonstrates how data files with well-defined formats can be
      manipulated by a wide variety of tools.

          demos:
          
              conquest.p  this
      program didn't appear at all in lecture, but i wrote it
      beforehand while playing around with enumerated data types, and
      it has some nice examples of doing things with them and 2-d
      arrays.  so i figured it would make more sense to put it up here
      than let it go to waste.
            
          
        
      

      10/18/96

          readings:
          section 11.9.  ignore the discussion in section 11.8 on
            parallel arrays.  the technique
            discussed there is almost always better done with an array
            of records as described in section 12.2.
          demos:
          
              toxic.p

      10/16/96
      midterm. the midterm will be give in class
        at the usual time and location.  it will be a closed-book
        test, covering everything discussed in class up to 10/11/96.
        you should be comfortable with the material in chapters 1, 2, 3
        (sections 3.1-3.4 only), 4, 5, 6, and sections 11.1-11.4 and
        12.1 and 12.2 in the book.  a sample
          midterm is available showing roughly the length and types
        of questions you should expect; you may wish to try going through
      this before the review session to see if you have any
      questions.  note that questions on the sample midterm are not
      exhaustive: the real midterm may touch on different subjects and
      use different types of questions.
        
          handouts:
          assignment five.

      10/4/96
      procedures with state.  most procedures maintain no
      information from one call to the next, so they always act
      exactly the same way.  sometimes this isn't what we want, so by
      used of a global variable or a call-by-reference parameter we
        can produce procedures like iterators (returning
        e.g. 1,2,3,4,5, etc.) or pseudorandom number
      generators (which return random-looking numbers; see also
        the library of useful
      procedures).

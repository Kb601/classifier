recent zpl language changes


  recent zpl language changes





the changes below are effective july 25, 1996.

the newly installed version of zpl is improved in two ways:  a 
multitude of small language changes have been incorporated to make 
the language more convenient/powerful, and many bugs have been 
fixed.  the resulting compiler is considerably more stable, and the 
language is more convenient.  however... 

most existing zpl programs will have to change somewhat.

though possibly causing some inconvenience for the moment, this is 
a one-time change.  zpl is essentially stable, with all subsequent 
research being applied to a new language.

the following language feature changes will likely require 
modifications to existing programs: 


   some data type have been introduced, eliminated, or renamed.  
       signed and unsigned byte data types are now supported (sbyte 
       and ubyte), and unsigned char no longer exists.  the
       unsigned data types have been renamed as summarized below.

        unsigned shortint ---> ushortint
        unsigned integer  ---> uinteger
        unsigned longint  ---> ulongint


  exponentiation added.  the binary operator ^  has been added.  the 
expression a^b raises a to the b power. the compiler generates a 
direct evaluation when b is an integer constant 2, 3 or 4. all other 
cases compile to a call on pow().  the functions sqr() and cube() have 
been removed.

   bit operations have been changed.

        &  --->  band(a,b)     bitwise and of integers a, b
        |  --->  bor(a,b)      bitwise or of integers a, b
        ~  --->  bnot(a)       bitwise negation of integer a
        ^  --->  bxor(a,b)     bitwise exclusive or of integers a, b
          bsl(a,b)      integer a left shifted b bit positions
        >> --->  bsr(a,b)      integer a right shifted b bit positions


  logical operations have been changed.

        and ---> &
        or  ---> |
        (! continues to be correct for logical negation)


  compound assignments >= have been removed.

  double brackets may optionally be removed in most instances.
dynamic region specifiers not involving prepositions do not require
double brackets.  thus

        [[1..m, i..n]]  --->  [1..m, i..n]
        [[1..m, *]]     --->  [1..m, *]

but

        [[1..m,i..n] at west]
        [[1..m, 1..n] with m]

require both sets of brackets.  this is not yet implemented.

  rank-defined arrays in procedure specifications have been 
replaced with dynamic regions that inherit their dimension information 
from the call site.  thus

        procedure example (x, y:[2] float);

becomes

        procedure example (x, y:[,] float);

the inheritance capability is available with all region specifications 
-- empty dimensions are inherited from the enclosing scopes.

  reduce, scan and flood operators have changed

        reduce   +\  --->  +&lt;&lt;
        scan     +\\ --->  +||
        flood    \\\ --->  &gt;&gt;

the heuristic here is that the result of reduce (&lt;&lt;) is "smaller" than 
the operand, the result of scan (||) is the same size as the operand, 
and the result of flood (&gt;&gt;) is "larger" than the operand.

  region change removed.
the region change construct, used to specify the regions for partial 
reduce and flood, has been removed.  thus, the "left arrow" construct

        [r 
is no longer legal.  accordingly, the partial reduce and flood 
operators have changed in that both specify a region following the 
operator which describes the operand.  this region, together with 
the region "on the statement" which describes the result, supply the 
needed region information for these operations.  

thus, for example in the partial reduction

	[1..n, 1]  a := +

the region following the operator is the region of the operand, i.e. 
the region to be reduced.  the region on the statement specifies the 
result region, which since relative to the operand region it has the 
second as a collapsed dimension, the elements of each row are 
added, and the result is stored into the first column of a.

similarly, for the flood

	[*,1..m]  fl := >>[3,1..m] a; -- replicate a's 3rd row into fl

the region following the operand specifies the array to be 
replicated, and the region on the statement specifies the region of 
the result.  so, relative to the result region the first dimension is 
collapsed.

i have conducted research in the
area of computational complexity, a subfield of theoretical computer
science.  computational complexity is the study of the
quantitative laws of computation.  its final goals are
(1) clarifying what makes problems hard, (2) classifying problems
according to their computational hardness, and (3) deepening on
trade-offs between comptuational resources.
the classification of problems is based on the model of
computtation (turing machines, boolean circuits, ram, etc.),
the mode of computation
(deterministic, nondeterministic, probabilistic, and so on),
and bounds on the recourses (time, space, depth, and so on).

my current research interests are:
design and implementation of parallel data-mining algorithms,
biomolecular computing, computation based on counting, and
sets with low information content.

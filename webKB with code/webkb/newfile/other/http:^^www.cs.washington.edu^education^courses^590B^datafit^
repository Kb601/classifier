the a(i)'s have some probability distribution.
consider a(i) - atrue -- the real values are placed at the origin.
this defines the uncertainties of a(0). 
goal:  find the distribution of a(i) - atrue without knowing
atrue or having infinite data sets.




consider a world where a(0) is atrue.  
hope that that world is not too different from the atrue world.
in particular, assume that the probability distribution of
as(i)-a(0) is like a(i)-atrue.
we can compute as(i)-a(0) and take that to be our answer.
each data set yields a point as(i)-a(0).
simulate enough sets to get a distribution of parameters.




you could analyze the cloud of points to get confidence
intervals for parameters independently.
or you could use a confidence region for all parameters simultaneously.
you choose the level (68%) and shape.
it is common to use constant chi-squared shapes around the
d(0) minimum.

point: you can learn something about the parameter
confidences by simulating the phenomenon.

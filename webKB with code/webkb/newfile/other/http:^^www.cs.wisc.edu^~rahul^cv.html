 resume 



 

 
 objective 
a career in design and development of systems software.
my background being in core system areas like databases, architecture,
operating systems and compilers and non traditional ones like the web.
 

 

 
 work experience 


summer internship in the integrated database server solutions group at the
 ibm almaden  research centre 
my primary project involved adding certain optimizations to the db2 query 
optimizer for queries involving merge joins and studying their impact using
the tpcd benchmark suite.
in the last few days i also did a performance study on web server 
(mis in particular) scalability on smp's(running windows nt) using the spec 
web benchmark suite.

summer internship at a defence research establishment in india ('93)

worked on a graphics project developing a visualization tool for the 
manufacturing process of a fighter plane (india's lca).

teaching assistant at wisconsin-madison
 have graded and consulted for cs302(c++ programming) and cs536(compilers)

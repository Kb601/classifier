pc lab:
the cs302 lab is located in room 1350 of the computer science and
statistics building.  there is a sign by the side of the room that
says "terminal room a".  to get to the lab you first need to be in
the new part of the building with green/grey carpeting.  then walk past
the green elevators and turn left down the long hallway.  1350 is the
first room on the left.  the lab is staffed by graduate student
consultants, so if you are having problems using the machines or
figuring out how to do things, they are a good first line of attack.

opening your account:
find an unused machine.  at the "wiley login" prompt type "newuser"
and press the enter key.   when the "password" prompt appears,
simply press the enter key.  this starts the newuser program.
the newuser program will ask you for your student id number, inform
you of your login name, and ask you to set your password.  students
having difficulty running the newuser program should come to the
systems lab, room 2350.

using windows:
if you have not used ms-windows before you should run the windows
tutorial.  select "windows tutorial" under the program manager "help"
menu item.  if you do not understand the last sentence, ask one of
your classmates or a lab consultant to help you.

accessing on-line information:
in cs302, all class information is available through the world wide
web (www).  information for your cs302 section may be found on your
instructor's home page.  you can access this information with a
program called netscape.  the netscape icon is located in the
"networking" group.  double click on the icon to start the application.

navigating to the section 6/section 9 home page:
you will start at the cs department home page.  all of the underlined
items are links to other pages.  you can click on the underlined items
to go to a new page (or click on the "back" button at the upper left of the
screen to back up).  
to get to the section 6/section 9 home page...

		 now select the "sections and instructors" link
		 find section 6/section 9 (gregory sharp) and click
	 
and you are there!   our home page will contain information pertaining
to our section, such as handouts and programming assignments (see if you can

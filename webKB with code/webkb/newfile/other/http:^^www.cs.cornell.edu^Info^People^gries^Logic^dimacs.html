symposium on teaching logic





            announcement and call for papers
   
                 dimacs symposium on
 
              teaching logic and reasoning 
                  in an illogical world    
       
          rutgers university   25-26 july 1996  
  


  sponsored by the dimacs special year on logic and algorithms 
           and the association for symbolic logic 
      in conjunction with the federated logic conference.  
     hosted by rutgers, the state university of new jersey  



logic and logical thinking are central to all disciplines and are
critical in the mathematical and computer sciences.  this symposium
will explore the teaching of introductory logic and logical thinking,
with a primary focus on the college level and a secondary focus on
the high school level.  the symposium will be interdisciplinary,
emphasizing and contrasting approaches used in mathematics, computer
science, natural sciences, and engineering.

the symposium seeks a sharing of ideas, rather than consensus, on how
to teach logic, so that all participants gain an appreciation for the
fundamental issues and ultimately are better able to motivate the
importance of logic and to convey the foundations of logical reasoning
to students.  topics of interest include, but are not limited to:


  
  pedagogical approaches
  cognitive models of logical reasoning
  empirical studies
  exemplary course material 
  innovative approaches
  courseware for teaching logic


 
submit an extended abstract (maximum of 4 pages) by 1 april 1996.
submissions in postscript form are preferred; email them to
lmc@cs.cornell.edu.  mail paper submissions to: david gries, computer
science, upson hall, cornell university, ithaca, ny 14853 usa.

notification of acceptance: 1 may 1.  camera ready and electronic
paper versions due: 1 july.  accepted papers will be published in a
locally available proceedings and on the world wide web.

cse 370 introduction to digital design (3) introductory course in 
digital logic and its specification and simulation.  boolean algebra, 
combinatorial circuits including arithmetic circuits and regular structures,
sequential circuits including finite-state-machines, use of programmable
logic devices.  simulation and high-level specification techniques are
emphasized.  offered: awsp.


course goals

 understanding of digital logic at the gate and switch level including
     both combinational and sequential logic elements.
 understanding of the clocking methodologies necessary to manage the
     flow of information and preservation of circuit state.
 an appreciation for the specification methods used in designing
     digital logic and the basics of the compilation process that 
     transforms these specifications into logic networks.
 facility with a complete set of tools for digital logic design
     with programmable logic devices as the implementation technology.
 to begin to appreciate the difference between hardware and software
     implementations of a function and the advantages and disadvantages
     of each.

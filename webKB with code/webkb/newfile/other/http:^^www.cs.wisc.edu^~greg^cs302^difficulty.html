cs 302 course difficulty



course difficulty

note: the following was written by an experienced cs302 
instructor.

here are a few sample comments on how hard some students found the
class last spring.


   ``the course is very, very hard. rather than getting 3 intermediate credits, it should be worth 4 advanced credits.''

   ``the assignments tend to take way too long and are very hard.''

   ``it shouldn't take 8-10 hours to write up a program.''

   ``this class should be 5 cr. it's ridiculous.''






do i find these comments to be correct?  i agree that the course
should be worth more credits, but i can't change that.  as your
teacher, i have a duty of giving you all of the material needed to be
sucessful in courses that have cs302 as a prereq -- a whole lot of
material and work is involved.  the comment, ``it shouldn't take 8-10
hours...'' is off base.  the students in my class only had eight
programs to hand in during the previous semester, but some students
thought that assignments should be something that are done the night
before due!  

assignments take a continous effort from the day assigned.  some
struggling is good for the mind, but please ask me questions and i
will help you!  this course is easy for some, and hard for others, but
in all, the course should not be a semester long hell.  

how much work do i think you should expect?  the usual guideline in
college is to expect to spend 3 hours outside of class for every hour
spent in class.  but keep in mind that 3 hours is an average across
the entire college spectrum from bowling to quantum physics.
where does cs302 fall in that spectrum?  expect 3-5 hours of reading
each week.  expect 9-10 hours of homework each week in which we don't
have exams.  so that could be 12-15 hours outside of class each week,
i.e. 4-5 hours for every hour in class.  


some students will be able to spend less time, and other may spend
much more.  please be prepared and if you find yourself
snowballing homework and studying, see me for immediate help outside of
class!

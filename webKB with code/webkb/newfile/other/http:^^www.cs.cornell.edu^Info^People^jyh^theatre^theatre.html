cornell center for the theatre arts, jason's page


i help organize a group of computer science people interested in the
theatre (specifically the cornell center for the theatre
arts).  we buy a block of season tickets, and i pass them out
during the year.  if someone can't make it on one of the days we've
bought tickets for, then i help them sell their old ticket and buy a
new one.  we also have a few extra tickets this year, for friends.
each ticket costs $5 (the season subscription was $30).  if you are
known to me or the cornell computer science department, and you are
interested in the theatre, send me mail (jyh@cs.cornell.edu), and i'll
include you in further mailings.

the importance of being earnest

manufactured mistaken identity, fractured romances, and upended
social conventions.

fires in the mirror: crown heights, brooklyn, and other identites
anna deveare smith, flexible theatre

a searing look at two cultures living in crown heights, brooklyn in
1991.  a young black child is killed when a hasidic man's car jumps a
curb.  an hasidic rabbinical student is stabbed and killed in an act
of retaliation.  the ensuing riots wracked a community previously
praised for its atmosphere of tolerance and diversity.  drawing from
over 50 interviews with crown heights residents--politicans,
activists, religious leaders, victims and perpetrators, fires in the
mirror acheives a compelling and sophisticated view of racial and
class conflict.

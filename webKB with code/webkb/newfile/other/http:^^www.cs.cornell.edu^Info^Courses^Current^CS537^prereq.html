cs 537 - topics



 pre-requisites for cs 537


the following are prerequisites for the course. if you feel you do not
meet one or more of these, please contact me (praveen@cs) to discuss
whether you should enroll for the course.


 knowledge of the basics of relational database systems, as taught
in cs 432. the broad topics that you should have at least a passing 
familiarity with are the relational data model, the relational algebra
and calculus, sql, file structures (heap and isam) and 
indexing structures (b-tree). these will be very briefly covered
again at the start of the course.

 ability to program with c++. the projects for the course will involve
adding code to a database system written in c++. if you have experience
writing c code, you might feel that you can pick up c++. some of the
c++ background info in the course home page might help you. if you have
never programmed in c or c++, you should talk with me before enrolling
for the course. also, take a look at the information on the term project,
to get an idea of what sort of programming is required.

 introductory courses in data structures(cs 410 or equiv) and
operating systems.

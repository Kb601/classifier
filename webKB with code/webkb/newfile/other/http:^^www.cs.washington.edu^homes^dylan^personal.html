         here's a link to my
         ``serious''
         home page, in case personal details aren't what you're
         after. 
         
         i've just added a list of
         things
         i like. i like to read other people's similar lists. i
         think they help to build a feeling of community. how? if
         someone has an interest in a little known, but amazingly
         good artist (like j. j. cale or taj mahal), or movie (delicatessen comes
         to mind), they might search for them with alta vista, and
         find a number of other like-minded people. maybe even people
         they already knew, but didn't know they shared an interest. 
         
         
         heidi and i recently returned from a trip to italy
         (mainly florence) to visit my sister-in-law
         lisa
         and her husband patrick. here's a picture of
         us
         in venice. 
         
         my interests include electronics (mainly audio),
         unit
         origami, cycling, hacking at school, rock climbing,
         ultimate frisbee and cross-country skiing. i'm also a
         dvorak
         keyboard advocate. some of my friends say i'm nuts
         because i enjoy
         hacking
         postscript. 
         
         i like chocolate.
         these
         cookies have enough of it. 
         
         i lost a bet involving a flow-bee. you can
         see
         the event if you're at all interested. ``thanks'' to ted
         romer for documenting this (in)auspicious event. 
         
         my officemates are stefan savage, mike feeley, przemyslaw
         pardyak, ashutosh tiwary, and famous post-docs wilson hsieh,
         and herve jamrozik. we work in sieg hall, which is
         purportedly the ugliest building on campus. 
         
         my wife, partner and best friend is
         heidi,
         a really neat (non-cs) person. she enjoys gardening, reading
         and cycling, but doesn't have enough time to do these things
         since she works for starbucks coffee. she is the ``coffee
         and beverage specialist'' for starbucks' research and
         development department.

         a note about this page:
         
         i built this page on my macintosh using claris'
         neat tool
         called home page. you can
         try
         it too. i formatted this in about 20
         minutes. it's just a big table. very slick interface.
         i found out about home page on the evangelist.

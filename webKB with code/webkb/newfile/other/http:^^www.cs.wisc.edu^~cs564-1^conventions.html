coding conventions




coding conventions


the following conventions are recommended.  thanks due to prof. fischer
and ranjani ramamurthy.  (admittedly, they are not followed in minibase to
the extent they should be.) 

 classes are named with a mixture of capitals and small letters.. start
   with a capital and do not contain any '_' or '-'.
   if class name is a concatenation of 2 words, the second word begins with
   a capital letter as well.

   for example:

        class recoverymanager{

        };


 first declare public methods, then public variables.
   later, private methods and then private variables.
 
   public methods and variables :: same rules as naming classes ::

   for example:

   status addentry(lsn_t lsn, int xid);

   lsn_t  reclsn;

   private variables/methods ::
   no capitals at all. all variables and methods start with an underscore.

   for example :

   int   _pgid_array[100];
   status _restart_undo(recxacttbl* xact_tbl);


 all global variables to begin with minibase_  ( basically the system name).
   the variable itself can begin with small letters.

   minibase_bufmgr ==> global buffer manager variable.


 all global functions begin with minibase_

   let the function name ( after minibase_) begin with capitals
   and break multi words with underscores.


   example :: minibase_print_routine();



 all macro definitions begin with minibase_ whatever..

 all filenames in  lower case..

the sample programs are ordered from most to least recent.  information
for how to get copies of sample code is given below. 
see working in unix with c++ for information
on how to compile and execute c++ code.

 how to get sample code

 on-line code samples often cover examples that are discussed in lecture.
 print out copies of these files, and bring them to lecture.  i suggest that
 you put examples with multiple files in their own directory to keep them
 separated.  copies of the samples may be gotten in one of several ways.   

 
  the files are linked to this samples page, and may be retrieve by
      using the file->save or the file->save as command of your
      web browser (i.e. mosaic or netscape...).  just go to the page(s) of
      sample code, and choose one of the save commands for your browser.  this
      is probably the easiest way to get copies when working from your home
      computer. you must save the files using the names given in the
      samples page for them to compile!
  you can also directly copy files to your computer science
      account by using the unix cp command.  if there is a single file
      for the sample code, enter the following command at the unix prompt, and
      replace the filename with the name of the file given in the list
      above.
      
         % cp ~cs367-4/public/html/samples/filename  ./
      

      if there are several files for the code sample, they will be placed in
      their own directory.  in this case you would enter the following command
      at the unix prompt, and replace the directory with the name of the
      directory shown in parentheses in the list above.
      
         % cp ~cs367-4/public/html/samples/directory/*  ./
      

      if you you are having problems, make certain that you have not
      mistakenly typed a "one" 1, where you should have typed an "el" l.  they
      look very similar.  the commands shown above do not have any "ones" in
      them.

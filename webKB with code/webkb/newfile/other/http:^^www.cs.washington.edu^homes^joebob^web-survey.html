what do you like about the web?


 hypertext navigation is easy. (9)
 it combines several information formats "seamlessly". (7)
 there is a great range and amount of information available. (5)
 i can easily access things i know about. (4)
 it can be quick. (3)
 i can download documents with a mouse click. (2)
 i can be my own publisher. (2)
 it can remember which pages i've visited. (2)
 it's well organized.
 it's open-ended and growing.
 it's free.
 it can be personal (e.g. individual home pages).
 i can create non-linear documents.
 global addressing works.


what could be improved?  what could be added?


 speed it up! (5)  (netscape is much faster than mosaic.)
 improve the ability to discover something on the web.  (5)
 improve the ability to find something when i don't know it's url. (4)
 no single index of resources. (3)
 improve authoring tools for document structure. (2)
 add text-formatting for mathematical notation and tables.
 permit embedding of postscript in documents.
 add more "types" of documents.  this can be done with .mailcap
or .mime.types.
 improve reliability of servers.
 discriminate quality of information on a page.  netscape visually
indicates which pages are cryptographically secure, but i don't think
this guarantees "quality" in the manner it was suggested.
 summarize information.
 estimate time of downloads (netscape does this).
 better hotlist and memory control.  netscape has hierarchical
hotlists, memory and disk cache control and proxies.
 hierarchical navigation of the web using forward and
back.
 better visualization of the web "tours".
 make retrieval asynchronous (this is done in netscape).
 prefetch less detailed images, then full images while user is reading
(netscape has this too!).
 ability to author forms (questionaires, surveys).
 grab source "structure", remove content, and use skeleton.
 universal man page browser.
 automated addess management.
 cross-web glimpse indexing.
 better (autonmated) copying and mirroring of servers.
 searching for and recognizing changed pages.
 flattening a hypertext document.
 viewing the web as a global file system.

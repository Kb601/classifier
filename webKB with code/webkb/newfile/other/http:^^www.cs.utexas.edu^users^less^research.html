research agenda

the laboratory for experimental software
systems (less) at the university
of texas at austin's department of computer sciences was formed in
september 1996 by four new faculty members --- lorenzo alvisi, robert blumofe, mike dahlin, and calvin lin --- to
aggregate resources and promote collaboration on research in
experimental software systems, particularly in the areas of
programming support and fault tolerance for cluster and web-based
applications.  this document gives a brief overview of research being
conducted in the less lab.

fault tolerant parallel computing with distributed shared memory
(alvisi and blumofe). prior work has shown that the combination of
a &quot;well structured&quot; parallel programming model, the
randomized &quot;work-stealing&quot; scheduling algorithm, and the
&quot;dag consistency&quot; coherence model of distributed shared
memory (a combination that form the basis for the cilk
parallel language and runtime system) yields efficient and predictable
performance both in theory and in practice.  furthermore, we claim
that by using an end-to-end design, algorithmic properties of
this combination can be leveraged to make such a system fault tolerant
with extremely low overhead and without redundant computation (except
during recovery).

we propose to use a combination of two new techniques ---
&quot;return transactions&quot; and &quot;causal logging of
reconciles&quot; --- that take advantage of the following key
algorithmic property of the well structuring, work stealing, and dag
consistency combination.  when a procedure activation is stolen, all
modifications made to shared memory by the stolen activation and all
of its descendants do not need to be seen by any other extant
activation except for the stolen activation's parent.  moreover, these
modifications do not need to be seen by the parent until after the
stolen activation returns.

the return transactions technique uses this fact to turn
each stolen activation into an atomic transaction.  this technique,
coupled with uncoordinated checkpoints, has already been shown to be
effective for a functional programming model.  in general, however,
with distributed shared memory, this technique is not sufficient as it
requires that all modifications to shared memory made by a stolen
activation and all of its descendants are buffered to create an atomic
transaction when the stolen activation returns.

to avoid potentially huge amounts of buffering, causal logging
of reconciles will use causal message-logging techniques to allow
modifications to shared memory to be flushed (reconciled) to backing
store even before the stolen activation returns.  in general, causal
message-logging requires that extra information of a fixed size is
piggy-backed on each message that effectively logs the message
(without requiring a synchronous write to stable storage).  with well
structuring, work stealing, and dag consistency however, this logging
only needs to be done for a specific subset of the reconcile messages,
and this overhead can be amortized against the cost of work
stealing.

reliable parallel scientific subroutine libraries (blumofe).
traditionally, parallel scientific subroutine libraries, such as
various parallel implementations of the basic linear algebra
subroutines (blas), have been coded by statically partitioning work
among a static set of processes or threads.  this approach has been
very successful for traditional parallel platforms in which each
program runs on a static set of (effectively) dedicated processors.
with the growing use and acceptance of smps and clusters for parallel
computation, however, this assumption of dedicated resources is no
longer valid, and it has been shown that applications and libraries
coded with static partitioning have very unreliable performance when
run on non-dedicated resources.  on the other hand, it has been shown
that by using wait-free synchronization techniques and a
dynamic partitioning (such as with work stealing), performance becomes
very reliable.  to make this point, we propose to code and make
available a set of libraries, including blas, for smps (and later
clusters) that use these techniques to deliver reliable and
predictable performance on shared resources.

wfs: an adaptive data framework for web computing (dahlin).
although an increasing amount of valuable data resides on the web,
current &quot;browser-centric&quot; data-access protocols limit its
use. this project seeks to provide stronger cache consistency and data
update guarantees that will enable new classes of web-based
applications.  because the physical characteristics of the internet
make it expensive to provide some of these guarantees, wfs will pursue
an adaptive and application-specific approach. the system will provide
a range of consistency and update options with different guarantees
and different costs, and applications will pay for only the guarantees
that they require. for example, a web browser may emphasize
scalability and continue to use the current read-only and weak cache
consistency approach. conversely, a distributed parallel computation
may require transactional updates and strict cache consistency even if
these guarantees limit its scalability to a few hundred nodes. two key
aspects of the project will be providing a framework for instantiating
different consistency and update algorithms under a common interface
and providing quantitative criteria that applications can use to
select appropriate algorithms.

lightweight fault-tolerance (alvisi and vin).
the objective of this research is to support and enable a new class of
truly distributed and fault-tolerant applications in which distributed
agents communicate through messages as well as files.  our proposed
lightweight fault-tolerance will have the following properties.


it will integrate with applications in a way that is transparent
to the application programmer.

its use will require few additional resources and have a
negligible impact on performance during failure-free executions.

its cost will be very low for the most common failures, and it
will scale depending on the severity and number of failures that need
to be tolerated.

it will address software-generated faults effectively.


to achieve transparency, we plan to engineer our solution as a
middleware.  to minimize dedicated resources, we plan to use rollback
recovery techniques.  to minimize the impact on application
performance and to scale the cost of our solution with the number of
failures that need to be tolerated, we plan to use causal
logging.

using current techniques, tolerating hardware-generated faults is
possible, but at the cost of potentially forcing the application to
block for every i/o operation while data critical to recovery are
logged to stable storage. specifically, one cannot assume that a file
read during the execution will still be available in its original form
during recovery. hence, input from the file system must be
synchronously logged to stable storage. furthermore, since the file
system in general cannot roll back, the application must delay output
to the file system until it executes an output commit
protocol, which requires synchronous logging to stable
storage. tolerating transient software-generated faults --- the
so-called heisenbugs --- through rollback-based techniques
becomes more problematic as well, since frequent writes to the file
system can limit the extent by which a process can roll back.

to address these problems, the middleware that we plan to build
will present the file system to the application not as a detached
component of the external environment, but as an integrated partner
that can be trusted to provide the data needed during recovery.  we
expect that this will drastically reduce the costs incurred by the
application in performing file i/o. specifically, our solution will
have the following benefits.


avoid synchronous logging of input data. if a client fails, the
middleware and the file system cooperate to guarantee that during
recovery, the client will receive the same data as it received before
failing.

avoid synchronous writes to the file server due to file
sharing. in our solution, clients can pass dirty data directly to each
other without using the file server to make the data stable. the
middleware guarantees that any dirty data kept in the volatile memory
of a client c, and passed to another client without first
being saved to the file server, can be regenerated during recovery if
c fails.

avoid a synchronous output commit protocol before writing a
file. the middleware and the file system cooperate to guarantee that,
if the client crashes, the application's state in which the output was
generated will never be rolled back.

enhance the effectiveness of rollback-based techniques for
software fault-tolerance. the middleware allows a client that
experiences a heisenbug to roll back past its last write to the file
system, increasing the likelihood of successful recovery.



parallel computing on the world-wide web with java (alvisi,
blumofe, dahlin, and lin). this project will use java as the basis
for a new parallel computing infrastructure, to be called jem
(pronounced &quot;gem&quot;) for the world-wide web.  the jem language
will augment java with simple primitives to express parallelism while
maintaining the well structured property.  the jem virtual machine
runtime system will use work stealing and dag consistency, and it will
provide transparent light-weight fault tolerance as described above.
these properties in further combination with existing java technology
will allow jem programs to run across heterogeneous resources and
untrusting resources.  thus, applications of national and
international importance, such as climate modeling, can be coded in
jem and run reliably on the aggregated resources of the entire
world-wide web, and applications of corporate importance, such as
scheduling, data mining, and simulation, can be coded in jem and run
reliably on the aggregated resources of the enterprise intranet.

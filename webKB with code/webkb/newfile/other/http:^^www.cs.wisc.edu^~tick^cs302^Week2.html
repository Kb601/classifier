   fortran line structure
   

   
      fortran programs are composed of lines, with one statement per line.
      each line has four sections:
         
            column 1 is the comment field.
            columns 2-5 is the line label.
            column 6 is the continuation marker.
            columns 7-72 is the actual fortran statement.
         

         
	 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ... 72
	+-+-------+-+---------------------------+
	 c  label  +         statement
	
   

   comment field
   
      comments are indicated by having a "c" (or "*") in column 1.
      comments take up the whole line. everything on the line is ignored by the compiler.
      comments explain what your program code is doing in plain english.
      
	 c compute the total cost from the
	 c unit cost and quantity ordered
	       totcst = untcst * quanty
      
   

   continuation marker
   
      if a statement is too long to fit in the 72 columns then it can be split over two or more lines.
      put a "+" in column 6 to indicate that the line is a continuation of the previous line.
      
	 c display the total cost
	       print *, 'the total cost is',
	      +          totcst, 'dollars'
      
   

   fortran statements
   
      all your fortran statements must start in at least column 7 (helpful hint: change your tab setting to 6 characters).  do not write any fortran statements starting in columns 1 to 6.
      right:
      
	  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ... 72
	 +---------+-+---------------------------+
	              totcst = untcst * quanty
      
      wrong:
      
	  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ... 72
	 +---------+-+---------------------------+
	  totcst = untcst * quanty
      
      anything past column 72 is ignored by the compiler.  if your lines are too long then split them over two lines with a continuation marker.
   

   

   
   fortran program structure
   
   
      all fortran programs have the same overall structure:
      
	 program header
	 variable declarations
         main executable section
         stop
         end
      
   

   program header
   
      gives the name of the program.
         
	      program enciph
         
   

   stop
   
      tells the program to stop running and return to ms-dos.
   

   end
   
      tells the compiler that this is the last statement in the program and it should stop compiling.
   

   

   
   fortran variables
   

   variable names
   
      variables store important values that your program will use or hold intermediate results.
      
	     totcst = untcst * quanty
      
      variable names must start with a letter, contain only uppercase letters or digits, and no longer than six characters.
      right:
      
	 totcst, quanty, index2
      
      wrong:
      
	 totalcost, 2b_or_not_2b
      
   

   variable types
   
      you must explicitly specify the type of each variable; i.e. what sort of value it will store.
      the most common variable types are:
      
         real - a real number with a decimal point and fractional part.
         integer - a positive or negative integer number (no decimal places).
         character - one or more characters (e.g. a word or name).
      
   

   variable declarations
   
      specify the variable type followed by the variable name(s).
      
	      real totcst, untcst
	      integer quanty
	      integer index2
      
      for character variables you must also specify the maximum length of the character string (optional if just one character long).
      
	      character *9 name
	      character char
      
      warning: if you don't explicitly specify the type of each variable then it will be declared a default type according to the i-n rule (see pg. 35). you must always explicitly declare every variable.
   

   constants
   
      if the value of a variable is known when you write the program and it never changes (e.g. pi) then turn it into a constant with the parameter statement.
      
	      real pi
	      parameter (pi = 3.141593)
      
      a variable turned into a constant cannot be re-assigned a new value later on.
      the parameter statement immediately follows the variable declaration.
   

   

   
   assignment statement
   
   
      to store a value to a variable you have declared use the assignment statement.
      
	      variablename = expression
      
      the variable is always on the left-hand side of the assignment statement.
      right:
      
	      totcst = untcst * 1.25
      
      wrong:
      
	      untcst * 1.25 = totcst
      
      the variable being assigned can also be part of the expression on the right-hand side.
      
	      count = count + 1
      
      first, the whole expression is evaluated to get the result, then the result is stored in the variable.
      the assignment statement does not mean variable equals expression but rather variable gets-assigned-the-value-of expression.  this is a subtle but important difference.
   

   

   
   arithmetic expressions
   

   aritmetic operators
   
      fortran supports all the standard mathematical operators:
      
         * - multiplication
         / - division
         + - addition
         - - subtraction
         and also
         ** - exponential (e.g. b^2 is written as b**2)
      
      example: translate the following quadratic equation into fortran
      
         2x^2 - 5x + 7 = y
      
      is written as
      
	      y = 2*x**2 - 5*x + 7
      
   

   operator precedence
   
      operators are evaluated in order of their precedence.  if several operators have the same precedence then they are evaluated left-to-right.
      
         first: exponental **
         second: multiplication * and division /
         last: addition + and subtraction -
      
      to over-ride the default precedence use parenthesis (...)
      
	     b - c
	 a = -----
	     d - e
      
      right:
      
	      a = (b - c) / (d - e)
      
      wrong:
      
	      a = b - c / d - e
      
      exception: consecutive exponents are evaluated right-to-left. example:
       
          y = x^(z^2)
       
       can be written as
       
	  y = x**z**2
       
   

   arithmetic functions
   
      fortran has many built-in arithmetic functions (see pg. 64 and appendix a):
      
        sqrt - square root
        sin - sine root
        cos - cosine
        tan - tangent
        exp - e^x
        alog - natural logarithm
        alog10 - logarithm base 10
        nint - round a real number to nearest integer
      
      functions can be used in any arithmetic expression.
      
	      y = exp(4.5) + tan(x + 2*sqrt(x))
      
      the arguments of a function can be either values, variables or even arithmetic expressions and are enclosed in parentheses (...).
      some functions have more than one argument separated by commas.
      
	      a = b + mod(c, 4)
      
   

   type matching
   
      the type of an expression should match the type of the variable the result is going to be stored in.
      
	 integer-variable = integer-expression
	 real-variable = real-expression
      
      if the types mismatch then the expression is automatically converted to match the type of the variable, truncating any decimal places if necessary.
      
	 real x
	 integer i

	 x = 6.6 * 1.6		(10.56)
	 x = 6.6 / 1.6		(4.1256)
	 i = 6.6 / 1.6		(10)
	 i = 6.6 / 1.6		(4)
      
      for all the operators, if both the operands are type integer then the result is also type integer.  if either operand is type real then the result is type real.

      warning: with division, if both the operands are type integer then the result is automatically truncated to an integer also!
      
	 2.0/3 = 0.66666
	 2/3   = 0 (!)
      
      important:always check the argument and return types for functions so you know whether or not your results will be truncated.
   

   real numbers
   
      real numbers can be written in either decimal or scientific notation.
      
         decimal: 12.3	
         scientific: 0.123e+2 (i.e. 0.1234*10^2)
      
      by default real numbers are printed in decimal notation.
   

   rounding errors
   
      numbers are stored inside the computer in binary format (i.e. as powers of 2)
      
         10 base 10 = 2^3 + 2^1 = 1010 base 2
      
      most fractions cannot be represented precisely in binary (e.g. 0.1) so instead the closest approximimation in base 2 is stored.  therefore, most real numbers are not stored precisely on any computer.
      
         0.1 * 10.0 does not equal 1.0 (e.g. = 0.999998)
      
      important: always use integer values and variables whenever possible because these are stored precisely. only use real values if you absolutely have to.
   

   storing in binary
   
      integers: binary string abcde converts by

a*2^4 + b*2^3 + c*2^2 + d*2^1 + e*2^0.
so 01000001 = 1*2^6 + 1*2^0 = 65

      characters: convert to ascii code value

(for example 'a' is stored as 01000001 i.e. 65)

      reals: stored in binary version of scientific notation.
      
         ab.cd in binary is
a*2^1 + b*2^0 + c*2^(-1) + d*2^(-2),

just as ab.cd in decimal is
a*10^1 + b*10^0 + c*10^(-1) + d*10^(-2)
so 1.0100 = 1*2^0 + 1*2^(-2) = 1 + 1/4 = 1.25

         recall in decimal
123.8 becomes 1.238 x 10^2 in sci. notation.

moving the decimal point multiplies of divides by two. in binary, since we have only two possibilities per digit (0 or 1), moving the decimal point multiplies and divides by 2.
so 1000.1 becomes 1.0001 x 2^3
(or, to write this completely in binary, 1.0001 x 10^101).

        also remember that sci. notation in decimal is of the form a.bcde x 10^f where a is between 1 and 9. in binary, since we only have 0's and 1's, a can only be a 1. so every time we convert to sci. notation in binary, we'll have a 1 there. therefore we don't even need to store the 1 (we know it'll always be there)...this gives us more storage space.

so 1.0100 is represented by only for digits...0100.

        so, suppose we're given 01000001 and told we're given 4 digits mantissa, 4 digits exponent. think of it as 0100 0001
so, in complete binary this is 1.0100 x 10^0001,
which converts to (1 + 1/4) x 2^1 = (1.25)*2 = 2.5

   

   
   character strings
   
      to assign a value to a character variable it must be either another character variable or a string enclosed in single apostrophes.
      
	      character *10 name1, name2

	      name1 = 'john doe'
	      name2 = name2
      
      the apostrophes are not stored in the variable.  to store an apostrophe inside and string type in two apostrophes.
      
	      name1 = 'john''s dog'			(john's dog)
      
      if the string is shorter than the variable then then variable is padded with blanks (denoted by a "#").
      
	      name1 = 'john doe'			(john doe##)
      
      if the string is longer than the variable then the excess characters are ignored; i.e. the string is truncated.
      
	      name1 = 'john doesnt'			(john doesn)
      
   

   

   
   input and output
   

   unformatted output
   
      to display results on the screen use the print statement.
      
	      print *, totcst
      
      to print multiple items on the same line separate them by commas.
      
	      print *, x, ' plus ', y, ' equals ', x+y
      
      you can print values, variables, arithmetic expressions or character strings.
      the next print statement prints on the next line, not on the end of the previous one.
      always prompt the user before asking him/her to type something in. otherwise when they run your program they will not know that the computer is waiting for them to enter a value.
      
	      print *, 'please enter the cost of the item'
	      read *, untcst
      
   

   unformatted input
   
      to read in data entered at the keyboard by the user use the read statement.
      
	      read *, untcst
      
      you always read in a variable you are specifying where the value is to be stored.  you never read in expressions or literal values.
      the user must press the enter or return key when he/she has finished entering in a line of data at the keyboard.
      
	 27enter
      
      to read in multiple values entered on the same line specify several variable separate by commas.
      
	      read *, day, month, year
      
      if the user enters multiple values on the same line he/she does not separate them by commas but uses spaces instead.
      
	 11  20  67enter
      
      the values the user types in must be entered in the same order and be the same type as the variables in the read statement.
   

   reading character strings
   
      when reading in character strings from the keyboard the user must surround them by apostrophes.
      
	 'gareth bestor'enter
      
      this may be undesirable and it can be avoided by using formatted input which we will discuss later (see program #0 for an example).
   
   types of errors
   
   syntax error: compile time problem. computer has no idea how to
translate part of your program. misspelling words (starting the first line
with problam instead of program, for example), using keywords (such as real)
as variable name, nonsense characters on lines are common examples.
   semantic error: compile time problem. lines can be translated
individually, but it doesn't make sense with regard to the entire program. for
example, typing implicit none and then trying to use a variable name not
delcared yet.
   run-time error: run-time problem. everything translates fine, but when
running there are certain steps the computer itself cannot do. saying y = z/0,
for example, is a legal statement but the computer cannot divide by 0. it will
compile, but fail running when the program reached this point.
   line-position error: can be any type of error, or none. occurs when
line rules not obeyed. can result in many things; example, if we had

read *,......ad nauseum,b,c

and the b was on the 72nd column, rest of the line would be ignored, and
you'd still have a legal statement (not reading in c may cause a problem later
in the program, though). if the b was on the 71st column, however, then only
the c would be ignored, and you'd have a syntax error (read cannot end with a
comma). 
   logical error: occurs at run-time (sort of). nothing wrong with the
program, but it's not doing what you wanted. the computer is doing just what
it's told, but you've written the program incorrectly. the hardest and most
annoying to correct (and why it's important to have the algorithm correct in
your head and on paper before you start typing it in)

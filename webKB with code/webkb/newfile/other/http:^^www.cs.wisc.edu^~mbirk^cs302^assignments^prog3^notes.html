 notes on the hangman programming assignment 

i have been getting a lot of questions about the hangman program.  some
people have had minor problems getting the string class to work, or
interpreting a particular error message.  however, others claim to be
completely lost, and cannot figure out how to approach the problem of
writing a program to play hangman.  maybe i didn't prepare you properly for
this assignment.  i don't think it is a terribly hard assignment, but i may
have rushed through the material on the string class.



so i decided to write a detailed document describing how to do the
assignment.  much of the code that you will need to use in your program is
given to you right here; all you have to do is assemble it into a coherent
structure and fill in the details.



note: the code in this document does not address a small problem:
treating both upper- and lower-case letters as the same.  instead, it treats
the two versions of each letter as totally different letters.  this is not
correct behavior for the assignment, though.  you are responsible for
modifying the program to handle upper- and lower-case letters.  if the user
guesses the letter 'e' (either upper- or lower-case), your program should
"reveal" all letters 'e' in the secret phrase (both upper- and lower-case).
however, i recommend that you do this only after you have the rest of
the program working.

 basic implementation 

one way to implement the hangman game is to keep two strings: the secret
phrase, and the "partially-revealed" secret phrase.  the secret phrase is
initialized at the beginning of the program and doesn't change.  the
partially-revealed secret phrase is the same as the secret phrase, but all
of the letters are "blanked out".  when the user guesses a letter in the
secret phrase, the corresponding letter in the partially-revealed secret
phrase is "unblanked".  for example, say the secret phrase is howdy
doody!.  then the partially-revealed secret phrase will contain the
string _____ _____! - each of the letters has been replaced with the
underscore character.



now, if the user guesses the letter "o", then the partially-revealed secret
phrase will be modified; for each "o" in the secret phrase howdy
doody!, the corresponding character in the partially-revealed secret
phrase is changed from the underscore character to the letter "o".

 pseudo-code 


 get random secret phrase
 initialize the "partially revealed phrase"
 initialize number of chances
 display partially revealed secret phrase
 initialize guessed letters to empty string


 loop until out of chances or secret phrase has been guessed
   
    ask user for guess
    if not a letter
      
       error "not a letter"
      
    else if already guessed
      
       error "already guessed"
      
    else
      
       add guess to string of guessed letters
       if guess is in secret phrase
         
          message "good guess"
          reveal matching letters in partially revealed phrase
         
       else
         
          message "bad guess"
          subtract one from number of chances
         
      
    display partially revealed secret phrase
   
 if secret phrase guessed
   
    message "congratulations"
   
 else
   
    message "sorry, secret phrase was: " secret_phrase
   



 get the random secret phrase 

for this program, you "get" the random secret phrase by calling the function
random_secret_phrase.  this function has the following prototype:




      string random_secret_phrase ();


 this prototype tells us that the random_secret_phrase function
has no inputs, and returns (outputs) a string.  so we call this function by
simply putting an empty pair of parentheses after its name:


      random_secret_phrase ();


however, if we just wrote this line in our program, it would call the
function, but throw away its return value!  this is definitely not what we
want.  in general, we must use the return value of a function in some way. 
for random_secret_phrase, its return value is a string which is
randomly selected from a list.  the appropriate thing to do with this string
is to store it in a variable, so we can refer to that value whenever we need
to.


      string secret_phrase = random_secret_phrase ();


this creates a variable secret_phrase of type string, and
initializes it with the value returned by the random_secret_phrase
function call.

 initialize the partially-revealed secret phrase 

the partially-revealed secret phrase should be the same as the secret
phrase, but with all letters changed to underscores.  non-letters, such as
the space character or punctuation should be left as is.  to decide if a
character is a letter, us the isalpha function.  this function is
declared in the header file ctype.h.  it has the following
prototype:


      bool isalpha (char ch);


this prototype tells us that the isalpha function takes one input,
a character, and returns a boolean value (true or false).  if the given
character is a letter, it returns true.


      string partial_phrase = secret_phrase;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; partial_phrase.length(); i++) {
         if ( isalpha (partial_phrase [i]) )
            partial_phrase [i] = '_';
      }


this code loops over each of the characters in the partially-revealed secret
phrase; each character that is a letter is changed to an underscore. since
we know the number of characters in the partially-revealed secret phrase is
partial_phrase.length(), we can use a simple counting loop.  we use
the bracket operator to access each character; the index variable i
tells us which character we are working on.

 checking whether a letter has already been guessed 

to decide if the user has guessed a letter previously, you need to keep
track of which letters they have already guessed.  this can be done with a
string that holds all previously-guessed letters.  at the beginning of the
game, this will be the empty string.  each time the user guesses a new
letter, add it to the end of the string.



to decide whether a letter has already been guessed, use the function
char_in_string.  this function has the following prototype:


      bool char_in_string (char ch, string str);


this tells us that the function has two inputs (one character and one
string), and returns a boolean (i.e., true or false) value.  if it returns
true, then one of the characters of the given string is the character
ch.



so, if you call this function, and supply as inputs the guess and the string
of previously-guessed letters, it will tell you whether or not the guess has
been made before.  the function call will look like:


      char_in_string (guess, guessed_letters)


but, as usual, we need to do something with the return value of this
function!  since char_in_string returns a boolean value, we can use
the return value as the condition of an if statement:


      if ( char_in_string (guess, guessed_letters) )


 add guess to string of guessed letters 


       guessed_letters += guess;


remember that the += is just a shorthand for the following:


      guessed_letters = guessed_letters + guess;


the character guess is automatically converted to a string, and the
+ operator concatenates the two strings into a single string.

 checking if the guess is in the secret phrase 

this step is similar to checking whether the guess had been made previously. 
use the char_in_string function, but instead of searching the
string of previously-guessed characters, search the secret phrase itself.


      if ( char_in_string (guess, secret_phrase) )


 reveal the matching letters in the secret phrase 

when the user guesses a letter which is in the secret phrase, you must
"unblank" the correct letters in the partially-revealed secret phrase by
changing them to the guessed letter.  do this by looping over each character
in the secret phrase; if that character is the same as the guess, then
"reveal" the corresponding character in the partially-revealed secret phrase
by changing it from an underscore to the corresponding character in the
secret-phrase.


      for (int i = 0; i 

 checking whether the game is over 

the game ends when either the player has run out of chances or has
completely guessed the secret phrase.  the first condition can be checked
with the boolean expression


      num_chances == 0


the second condition can be checked by comparing the secret phrase to the
partially-revealed secret phrase.  if they are the same, then the player has
won the game.  this can be checked with the boolean expression



      secret_phrase == partial_phrase


the game ends when either of these two boolean expressions is true:


      num_chances == 0 || secret_phrase == partial_phrase


however, the game must continue as long as neither of these conditions is
true.  thus the condition in our loop would be:


      while (num_chances > 0 && secret_phrase != partial_phrase) {

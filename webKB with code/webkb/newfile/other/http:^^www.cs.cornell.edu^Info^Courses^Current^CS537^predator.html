what is predator?

the predator database system (predator enhanced data type object-relational dbms) is an object-relational dbms built as a research
prototype to study how complex data types should be supported.
existing technology is based on the notion of abstract data types (adts): each data type is encapsulated through a well known interface,
and the database system maintains an extensible table of adts. 
each adt provides a bunch of user-level methods that can be
applied from within an sql query to operate on adt values.
the predator system recognizes that the cost of adt operations
can dominate database performance. consequently,
the adt notion is "enhanced" so that each data type can
maintain meta-information, use that meta-information for
optimizing operations on the adt, and apply optimizations
on expressions involving concatenations of adt operations.
further, each data type can provide a "query language" in which
complex operations on that type can be expressed. this
enhanced abstract data type (e-adt) paradigm is the 
basic technology in predator. providing the support for
this paradigm requires a fundamental redesign of many
components of a traditional object-relational dbms.
the purpose of predator is to fully explore the e-adt
idea, and to see how queries involving complex object
expressions can be further optimized by exploiting
interactions between e-adts. the current focus of work
is to build support for several different data types,
each of which can co-exist independent of the others.


the e-adt paradigm

the e-adt paradigm is explained in detail in 
a technical report, 
also being submitted as a paper to acm sigmod 97. this document
also describes the high-level architecture of predator,
the interesting design issues, possible extensions of the current
technology, and open problems for future research.


system code structure

the detailed code design is described
here. this may not always be
upto date, because the code base is constantly being
updated. for most students in cs537, you will only
need to concentrate on the portion of the design document 
dealing with the sql engine, and/or the portion dealing with new
data types.


installation instructions

these instructions are only for cornell cs537 students.
for others, predator is not yet a publicly available piece
of software, but it will be in a few months. 
here are the installation instructions and
some  quick tests  you can run.


system development

look here for some tips on system
development in predator.

coding conventions

when adding to predator, it is crucial that you follow 
the same coding conventions that have been used 
relatively uniformly throughout the code. 
click here to get to a list
of dos and don'ts. the document also tells you how to use rcs,
a simple source code control mechanism used to manage
the distribution of predator code.


testing

initially, after installing your code, you should
try some  quick tests . on a more regular
basis, as you add code, you should run a test suite that is being
developed for predator. details of this test suite and how to
run it are  here .

predator is built using the shore storage manager as the
data repository.

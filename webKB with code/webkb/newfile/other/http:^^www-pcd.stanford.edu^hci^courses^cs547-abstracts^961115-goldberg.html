jobs in commercial software development are team jobs. the teams build
systems that bring value to their customers. new hires, whether fresh out of
school or transferring from other commercial projects, are successful only
if they can contribute to the team's goals. yet the formal education of
these new
hires emphasized programming, not system building, and rarely offered team
experience in creating and maintaining large systems. what might a
curriculum focused on teaching system building contain? 


faced with that question, i set out to design a new system that would
support authoring and delivering such a curriculum. the result is
learningworks , available for free on the internet. the purpose of this talk is to
discuss the user interface design for learningworks, specifically how the
simple metaphor of learning books can be used both to teach software system
building concepts and to support teams in building systems.

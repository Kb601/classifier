parallel ray tracing in cc++

we propose to parallelize an existing implementation of a ray tracer called
 raylab, which is a public domain software. 

this sample scene (640x480, reduced here) took approximately 11 minutes to
 render on the sequential version.




we have finished learning cc++ and now intend to investigate strategies for
 parallelization of the code. we will then convert the program first to c++
 (program is currently in c) and then to cc++.
we hope to come close to a speed-up of n. the program will be implemented
 on the sp-2 port of cc++.

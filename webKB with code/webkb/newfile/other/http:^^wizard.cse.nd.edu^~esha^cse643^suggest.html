 cse 643: principles of parallel computing 



 the suggestions of 
 research papers to be presented
 

i will not just hand in the papers for you to read, but i will
give you some pointers for you to look for more papers in the
following areas. there are several journals and conferences
are important to go through such as ieee transactions on 
parallel and distributed systems, proceedings of icpp, ipps, spdp, etc.
please come to see me, and i may give you some starting papers.
 

 cache issues: cache design, cache coherence
 branch prediction issues           
 data dependency analysis, distribution and partitions
 loop transformation techniques 
 data locality for distributed shared memory systems
 task partitions and scheduling
 multicast routing techniques
 interconnection networks issues
 issues on real-time systems
 fault tolerance
 memory or disk io organizations 
 parallel programming languages survey 


 the suggestions of term projects 
term projects can be done by either a group of two or
individual.
one possible project is to come out some ideas and do 
simulation to verify your idea.
for example, you can simulate some routing teachniques,
scheduling techniques, interconnection networks,
data distributions, branch prediction, cache 
coherence, etc.
i don't want you to waste your time, so please do something
interest you.

bilth gater and the galactic empire 



episode 2 - the space rooster: there is little pond on
the microsoft campus fondly termed "lake bill" by the employees. near the lake
lived a wild rooster and his mate. they fed on the tidbits the employees
gave them. the rooster disappeared one day, and it was later discovered that
an unleashed dog had killed him. there was a big hoo-hah in the newsletter
about this, with people writing heartfelt eulogies to the gentle rooster.
this strip was my reaction to that...

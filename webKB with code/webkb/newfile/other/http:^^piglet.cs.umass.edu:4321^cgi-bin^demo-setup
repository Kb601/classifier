submitting the following form will run a demo which will attempt to
pop a window up on your screen.  if necessary, put your console host
in the entry marked x display.

you will also need to type  xhost +piglet.cs.umass.edu 
in a shell to allow piglet to set up a window on your screen.  the
demo will not work otherwise!


there is a 10 minute timeout.


note: piglet is a sparcstation 2 under variable load -- some demos
may slow down or momentarily stop, depending on piglet's work load.

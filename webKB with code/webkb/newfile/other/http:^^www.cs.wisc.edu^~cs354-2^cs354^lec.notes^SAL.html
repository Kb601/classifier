 chapter 2 -- sal



about sal
---------

motivation for sal:
     hiding the details of mal, mips asm. lang. (on purpose!)
     sal code will look more like hll code -- to make student's transition
	  easier.
     introducing one more level of abstraction in order to postpone
	  discussion of several topics.


     hll           sal         assembly          machine code


     each hll statement maps into 1 or more sal instructions
     each sal instruction maps into 1 or more mal instructions

     for this course, there is actually one more layer that
     students will be given

     hll        sal     mal       tal      mips risc machine code




sal

a subset of the functionality of most high level languages --
     no records/structures
     no formal arrays (see chapter 7 for their implementation)

what is required by a programming language?
  declarations
  arithmetic operations
  conditional execution (if then else)
  looping control structures
  communication w/user. . .(write statement)


about sal:
 -- one instruction, declaration per line
 -- comments are anything on a line following `#'
    (comments may not span lines)




declarations
------------

  - they give information about how much memory space is needed
  - they assign a name to the memory space

  sal has 3 basic types: integer, float (real), character
  can build other types out of these,
       for example, boolean is really an integer with only 2 defined values.
  
  pascal:
       var        variablename:  type;

  c:
       type     variablename;

  sal:
       variablename:  type value


     type is       .word      if integer
		   .byte      if character
		   .float     if real (floating point)

     value is optional -- it gives the variable an initial value

  examples:
       flag:  .word   0

       counter:   .word   0

       variable3: .word

       e:  .float   2.71828

       uservalue:    .byte

       letter:    .byte 'a'



other useful rules:
  -- one declaration per line.
  -- default initial value is 0.



directives
----------
  a way to give information to the assembler.

  - all directives start with `.' (period)

    examples:

	 .byte
	 .word
	 .float

	 .data       # identifies the start of the declaration section
		     #   there can be more than 1 .data section in
		     #   a program


	 .text       # identifies where instructions are
		     #   there can be more than 1 .text section in
		     #   a program

	 .asciiz  "a string.\n"  # places a string into memory
				 # and null terminates the string.

	 .ascii  "new string."   # places a string into memory
				 # without null termination.





arithmetic operations
----------------------

     sal             pascal             c

     move x, y       x := y;           x = y;
     add x, y, z     x := y + z;       x = y + z;
     sub x, y, z     x := y - z;       x = y - z;
     mul x, y, z     x := y * z;       x = y * z;
     div x, y, z     x := y div z;     x = y / z;
     rem x, y, z     x := y mod z;     x = y % z;

   notes: 1. the operation result depends on the type of the variables.
	  2. cannot increase the number of operands.
	  3. y and/or z can be immediates


   examples:

      move  count, 0

      mult  product, mult1, mult2

      add   sum, 2, addend


note:  there are other instructions that implement boolean functions,
       but we don't cover them yet.



conditional execution
---------------------
  sometimes an instruction (or a set of instructions) should
  be executed, and sometimes it (they) shouldn't.

  hll -- simplest form is a go-to.  (always discouraged.)


pascal if-then-else
  (a conditional go-to!)

   if (condition) then
       statement
   else
       statement;


c if-then-else

   if (condition)
       statement;
   else
       statement;


sal 'ifs' and 'gotos'
--------------------------------
    sal                  pascal

    b label             goto label;
    bltz x, label       if x  0 then goto label;
    blez x, label       if x = 0 then goto label;
    beqz x, label       if x = 0 then goto label;
    bnez x, label       if x <> 0 then goto label;
    beq x, y, label     if x = y then goto label;
    bne x, y, label     if x <> y then goto label;
    blt x, y, label     if x  y then goto label;
    ble x, y, label     if x = y then goto label;




example:
--------
  pascal if-then-else:

       if (count  0 ) do
       begin
	   a := a mod count;
	   count := count - 1;
       end;

  bad style pascal:

       while: if  (count  0) {
	   a = a % count;
	   count --;
       }

  sal:

      while: blez  count, endwhile
             rem a, a, count
             sub count, count, 1
             b while
      endwhile:    # next program instruction goes here




repeat loop example

  pascal:

       /* do statement until expression is true */
       repeat
	   if (a  b) then
	      a := a - 1;
       until a = b;


  c:
       /* do statement while expression is true */
       /*   when expression is false, exit loop */
       do {
	   if (a  b)
	       a--;
       } while( a != b);


  sal:

      repeat:    bge a, b, secondif
                 add a, a, 1
      secondif:  ble a, b, until
	         sub a, a, 1
      until:     bne repeat



while loop example
  pascal:

           while (count

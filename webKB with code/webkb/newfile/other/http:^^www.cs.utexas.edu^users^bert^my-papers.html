      sqsim: a simulator for imprecise ode models. 
     technical report ai96-247, artificial intelligence laboratory,
     the university of texas at austin, austin, texas, 78712, march 1996.  

     describes sqsim, an extended version of the qsim simulator that computes
     numerical bounds on imprecisely-defined ode models.
     

 herbert kay and benjamin kuipers.
           numerical behavior envelopes for qualitative models. 
     in   proceedings of the eleventh national conference on artificial
     intelligence (aaai-93),  pages 606-613, 1993.  mit press.

     describes the dynamic envelope envelope method as implemented in nsim, 
     an extension to qsim that generates predictions for semiquantitative
     models.  
     

 herbert kay and lyle h. ungar.
           deriving monotonic function envelopes from observations. 
     in   working papers from the seventh international workshop on
     qualitative reasoning about physical systems.  pages 117-123, 
     orcas island, washington, 1993. 

     describes the squid (semiquantitative identification) method for
     constructing bounds on a semiquantitative model of a continuous
     system by using measurements from the system.

           a qualitative model of the space shuttle reaction control system. 
     technical report ai92-188, artificial intelligence laboratory,
     the university of texas at austin, austin, texas, 78712, september 1992.  

     describes a qsim model of the space shuttle's reaction control system.
     the  qsim model  is also available.

           monitoring and diagnosis of multi-tank flows using qualitative reasoning. 
     master's thesis.  the university of texas at austin.  may, 1991. 

     describes the nsim algorithm and applies it to the problem of monitoring
     a high vacuum chamber during pumpdown.

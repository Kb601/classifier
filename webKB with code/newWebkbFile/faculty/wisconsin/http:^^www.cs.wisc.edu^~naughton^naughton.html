research interests
olap, multi-dimensional data analysis, parallel object-relational
dbms. the overall goal of my research is the development of
database systems that surpass current database systems both in
performance and in ease of use.  currently i have three main areas of
interest. (1) techniques for improving the performance of
multi-dimensional data analysis, including array-based storage and
processing algorithms, bit-map indices, and algorithms for computing
the "cube"; (2) the performance of object-relational database systems,
including benchmarking o/r dbms, algorithms for set-valued
attributes, and techniques for parallelizing o/r workloads; (3)
parallel geo-spatial information systems.

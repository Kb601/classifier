ph.d., university of wisconsin, 1968 
interests:
linear and nonlinear network optimization, parallel algorithms
for large-scale optimization 



 research summary 

most large-scale optimization problems exhibit substructures that
make possible solutions via algorithms with a high degree of parallelism.
such substructures include quasi-independent blocks of constraints
for different commodities or time periods or scenarios, and geographically-disjoint
components in approximating solutions. in the case of network
optimization, decomposition into approximating linear network
subproblems is particularly attractive because of the corresponding
very fast solution techniques. the emphases of my research have
been the development of new parallel optimization algorithms that
utilize these features and techniques such as genetic algorithms
to take advantage of distributed computing environments in order
to efficiently solve linear and nonlinear network optimization
problems containing millions of variables.

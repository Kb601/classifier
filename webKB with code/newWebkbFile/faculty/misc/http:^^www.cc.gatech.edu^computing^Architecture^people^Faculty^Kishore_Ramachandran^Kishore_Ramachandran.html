personal trivia...

i am married to vasanthi, and we have two children hemant (9 years of age
on 9/18/95)
and shalini (7 years of age on 1/23/96).
i am an avid squash player, and can be arm-twisted to hold a tennis
racket every once in a while!  



professionally speaking...

i received my ph. d.
in computer science from the university of wisconsin, madison in 1986
under the direction of
marvin solomon.
since then i have been with georgia tech (home of the yellow jackets),
where i am currently an associate professor in the college of computing.
my research interests are in the area of
architectural design, programming, and
analysis of parallel and distributed systems.
i was a co-principal investigator for the clouds distributed operating system
project at georgia tech.  currently i am investigating software
and hardware mechanisms for building scalable shared memory systems, and
studying the scalability of parallel systems from an applications perspective.
i received a presidential young investigator (pyi) award from the
national science foundation (nsf) in 1990, and the georgia tech doctoral
thesis advisor award in 1993.

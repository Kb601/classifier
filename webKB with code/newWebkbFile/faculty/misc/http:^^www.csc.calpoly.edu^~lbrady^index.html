    information retrieval [ir]
   
	application of ir techniques to distributed electronic documents on 	the
internet, in particular in the area of resource indexing and 	discovery. 
	rather than publish the obligatory list of interesting web 	documents, i
have decided to publish a list of 
	queries 
	for use with [web] search engines. the 
	beginning 
	of my "queries" document discusses some of the reasons for doing 	this.
	
	i am also is interested in problems of indexing
	multimedia materials, in particular photographs and and video
	clips, and in indexing software documentation, both text and
	diagrams.
	
	
	 computers & the arts
	
computer music,
particularly algorithmic composition. 
computer [midi] control of acoustic instruments. 
computer control of 3d art 
computer graphics applications in the visual arts.

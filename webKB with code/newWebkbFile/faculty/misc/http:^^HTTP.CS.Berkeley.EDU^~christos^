office hours and ta to be announced.

 i am also a cs undergraduate advisor.  office hours for the week
of august 19:  tue 10-12, thu 2-4, fri 10-12.

i came to berkeley in january 1996 (but i was here also in 1979 as
a miller fellow).



 i am interested  in the theory of algorithms and
complexity, and its applications to databases, optimization, ai, 
and game theory.

  
 i have written  these books 

  elements of the theory of computation  
(prentice-hall 1982, with harry lewis,  second edition
to appear soon )
  combinatorial optimization: algorithms and complexity
 (prentice-hall 1982, with ken steiglitz)
  the theory of database concurrency control

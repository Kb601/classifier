research 


   the primary objective of our research is to design, construct, and
   empirically evaluate computational mechanisms to support
   intelligent human-computer interaction in educational and
   scientific software.  in particular, we focus on developing
   advanced animated and natural language explanation systems
   that facilitate learning and scientific analysis.  we pursue this
   work in three areas: knowledge-based learning environments,
   intelligent systems for molecular biology, and natural language
   generation.  much of this research is conducted through the
   intellimedia
initiative.

   knowledge-based learning environments


	      research focus: animated pedagogical agents,
                     design-centered learning environments, intelligent
                     interfaces, and task modeling.

   	   projects: design-a-plant

       intelligent systems for molecular biology

	    research focus: interactive advisory systems for
                     homology searching, heterogenous genomics database
                     integration, and explanation generation for complex
                     analysis tasks.

	  project: the genome collaborator

       natural language generation

 	   research focus: explanation systems, natural
                     language revision,
		     functional/systemic realization,  knowledge-based
                     document planning.

industry collaborations
         our research benefits considerably from 
                partnerships with industry.

          glaxo wellcome: in collaboration with gw's
		bioinformatics group, we
                are conducting research on intelligent systems for
                molecular biology.

          ibm: in collaboration with ibm,
                we are creating new intelligent agent technologies.

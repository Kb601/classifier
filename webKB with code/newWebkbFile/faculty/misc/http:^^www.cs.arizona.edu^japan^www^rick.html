 richard d. schlichting 



 rick received the b.a. degree in history and mathematics (computer science
option) from the  college of
william and mary  in 1977, and the m.s. and ph.d. degrees in computer
science from  cornell university 
in 1979 and 1982, respectively.  

 since 1982, rick has been in the 
department of computer science  at 
the university of arizona , where he is currently 
holds the rank of professor.  his research interests include 
distributed systems, fault-tolerant computing, and heterogeneous 
scientific applications.  in the latter area, he heads the 
 schooner project ,
whose goal is to provide software support for constructing scientific
meta-computations across networks of heterogeneous machines.
much of his current work in fault-tolerant computing involves
using the x-kernel in various ways to support fault-tolerance, and is done
in cooperation with members of the 

network systems research group .
he currently supervises one postdoctoral 
associate (
matti hiltunen ), 
and four graduate students
(
nina bhatti , ilwoo chang, xiaonan han,
and 
don waugaman ).

 rick is also active in promoting increased 
interaction between u.s. and japanese computer scientists. 
he spent seven months in 1990 visiting the 
 
katayama laboratory at tokyo institute of technology ,
where he worked on using an attribute-grammar formalism to implement
fault-tolerant software.  he is currently spending a year at

hitachi central research laboratory near tokyo working on
various software issues related to heterogeneous scientific computation. 
both of these visits have been supported by
the nsf u.s.-japan cooperative science program.

 rick is a member of acm, ieee, and 
the 
ifip working
group 10.4 on dependable computing and fault-tolerance.  
he is on the editorial boards of ieee transactions on computers,
ieee parallel and distributed technology, and
the springer-verlag series on dependable computing and fault-tolerant systems.
he is also current vice-chair of the ieee technical committee on
fault-tolerant computing, and has served on numerous conference
program committees in the areas of fault tolerance and distributed 
computing.
he was general chair of the second ifip working 
conference on dependable computing for critical applications in 1991,
and program committee chair of the thirteenth ieee symposium on
reliable distributed computing in 1994.

 as part of his japan activities, rick heads the
 japancs
project , and is founder and
current moderator of the usenet newsgroup 

comp.research.japan , an
electronic forum devoted to japanese research developments in
computing and computer science.
he is also a member of the association of research libraries
working group on japanese scientific and technical information.

 when not working, rick likes to haunt local japanese restaurants
with his family.  their favorite is samurai, which during the winter
months serves the best miso ramen this side of japan.  rick also
follows the arizona wildcat sports teams.

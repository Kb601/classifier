 research interests 



the study of design is the study of intelligent behavior. humans are unique
in their ability to design artifacts to change the environment around them, both physical and intellectual. thus, the study of design is central to the study of
artificial intelligence.  
the following projects blend research in agent-based systems (decentralized control, with opportunistic interaction to achieve design goals), optimization,
and knowledge systems.


 
automated configuration design service (acds) : is a multi-agent 
concurrent-engineering system for designing artifacts from part catalogs. 
  
hierarchical concurrent engineering : extends the acds framework to support optimization in hierarchical organizations, which are typical in large design organizations.

i also am involved in 
the university of michigan's digital library project , where i lead the development of the agent architecture.

 some research papers  are available (more 
on the way).


graduates students in my research group:
tim darr
joe d'ambrosio
frtiz freiheit
sun park
eric glover
susan mcdaniel


my students and i meet once a week to discuss research papers that are related 
to our work, or are just plain fun. any student or faculty member 
is welcome to these meetings. the  schedule of topics  is available.

 teaching activities: 

  school of information : si 609:
   
"foundations"  (fall '96)
eecs 373: design of 
microprocessor-based systems (fall '96)
eecs 543:
 knowledge systems  (fall '95)
eecs 592: advanced artificial intelligence. 
(winter '96)



 associated activities 
i'm on the editorial board of the following publications:

  artificial 
intelligence for engineering design, analysis and manufacture  (ai edam)
  ieee expert 



 other stuff 
my wife,  stacy
 bike , is a professor in the 
 chemical engineering department. 
back by popular demand: see 
who 
engineered the greatest peacetime economic expansion.

homepage for brian harvey (bh@cs.berkeley.edu) 

 

i teach many of the lower division (freshman and sophomore)
computer science courses
at berkeley.  i'm faculty advisor of the
computer science
undergraduate association and of the
open computing facility.

i'm also interested in the use of computers in
pre-college education; i used to be a high school
teacher, and i'm involved in the development of the logo programming
language.

berkeley logo
is a freeware interpreter that i wrote along with
several students.  (major contributors are dan van blerkom,
michael katz, and doug orleans.)  click here to retrieve
the complete distribution archive for
unix,
dos, or
mac,
complete with c source code.  (if you think logo is just a graphics
language for little kids, check out a
sample program
that should impress you.)

    



intermediate programming,
a logo programming text that concentrates on natural language
processing rather than the graphics most people associate with logo.
projects, styles, and techniques,
a collection of ten largeish logo programs with commentary on the
structure and style of each.
advanced topics,
brief introductions to six college-level computer science topics.


the computer science logo style books are out of print,
but you can order a bound photocopy from

mit document services.  the second edition should be published
early in 1997.



i've written several papers about
computers and education.

i'm a member of computer
professionals for social responsibility,
the league for programming freedom, and the
american civil liberties union.

so, what do you do for fun, brian?


i visit the exploratorium,
the world's best museum.
i watch the 
animaniacs, the only good thing on television.
i listen to 1964-1968 british rock, especially the 
beatles.

food.

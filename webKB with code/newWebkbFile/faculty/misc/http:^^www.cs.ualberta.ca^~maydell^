 research areas 



communication networks


research interests
my current research activities are in the areas of telecommunication
networks and medical imaging systems for hospitals.
i find designing new network systems and studying their performance,
as well as improving the performance of existing systems, very exciting.

my research in telecommunication networks has resulted in techniques
which will make networks more efficient.
more people will have access, and fewer will get a busy signal due to
telephone network overloads.
if there is a heavy overload, as on the famous mother's day peak,
the new protocols will reduce congestion.

hospital networks for medical data and digital x-rays are starting to
exist and will help patients and physicians have faster access to
medical information.
i have been involved in evaluating the performance of standards
for such medical communication networks.

currently, i am exploring new approaches for fast and economical
multicast routing schemes for multi media transmission in the atm
environment, especially for multicast interactive sessions with large
groups over wide area networks (internet).

i enjoy working with students and helping them.
i find discussions with students very exciting and motivating.

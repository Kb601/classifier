java for wavelets
java is still a bit painful, but it provides extraordinary potential
for use in research and teaching. here is a small collection of
subdivision and wavelet related applets that students, collaborators,
and i myself have written. check them out!

  a simple demonstration of how to draw smooth curves through
      corner cutting (and my first
      attempt at java...). this is an instance of subdivision which is
      intricately linked to wavelet constructions.
  one of the students in cs274b, dmitri linde, took this applet
      as a starting point for his homework
      assignment. it demonstrates b-splines and bezier curves of
      varying order and lenght all rolled into one application. they
      are all generated through subdivision.
  dmitri linde also implemented his cs274b project
      in java. awesome!
  wim sweldens wrote a little applet that allows you to explore
      the space of all four tap wavelets.

watch this space for more to come as mike astle
and dae kang start hacking java this summer!

news
i was just named a sloan
foundation fellow (caltech press
release) and an nsf national
young investigator to work on ``wavelet
methods: connecting theory and application.''

research interests

my main interest right now is in multi level methods. so far
this has been happening under the headline of wavelets, but we
are generalizing the ideas more and more, so whether it should still
be called wavelets is up to debate. an overview of research projects in the computer graphics
group as a whole gives some more ideas about concrete projects that
are happening or about to happen.



publications

almost everything is available online but not all of it in fancy html
yet. here are a few

   wavelets in computer
      graphics course notes for
      siggraph 96 (with wim sweldens,
      michael cohen, tony derose, and david salesin). the first two chapters are the
      latest (and much improved...) guide to ``building your own
      wavelets at home.''
   interpolating subdivision for meshes with
      arbitrary topology (with denis zorin and wim sweldens),
      cs-tr-96-6. final siggraph version and some
      cool pix: mannequin, tetrahedron, pipes, and venus (david coming soon...)
   wavelets in computer
      graphics, to appear in a special issue of the
      proceedings of the ieee.
   spherical wavelets: efficiently
      representing functions on the sphere (with wim
      sweldens), appeared in proceedings of siggraph 95.
   spherical wavelets: texture processing
      (with wim sweldens), appeared in rendering techniques
      `95, springer verlag.
   textures and radiosity: controlling
      emission and reflection with texture maps, (with reid gershbein,
      and pat hanrahan), appeared in proceedings of
      siggraph 94.
   
      wavelet image compression appeared in wired magazine, 3.05, may 1995.
   on the formfactor between
      two polygons (with pat hanrahan), appeared in
      proceedings of siggraph 93. there is also a tr version which gives all the
      gory details, mathematica code,
      and even a c library which
      implements the form factor expression (of course without any
      guarantees that it will always work...).
   building your own wavelets at
      home (with wim sweldens), appeared as a tr.
   data parallel volume rendering as
      line drawing (with gordon stoll), appeared in
      proceedings of acm volume visualization workshop, 1992.

i have also contributed to the siggraph notes for the wavelets in computer graphics
course held at siggraph 95, los angeles.

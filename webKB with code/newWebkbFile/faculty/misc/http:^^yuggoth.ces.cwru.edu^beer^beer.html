research interests my general area of interest is the
adaptive behavior of autonomous agents.  more specifically, i am
interested in the evolution of dynamical neural networks for
autonomous agents, the analysis of evolved dynamical neural networks,
biologically-inspired robotics, neuroethological modeling, and the
theory of adaptive behavior.

associate professor henry d. shapiro






wenn der kummer naht,
liegen w&uuml;st die g&auml;rten der seele,
welkt ihn und stribt die freude, der gesang.
dunkel is das leben, ist der tod.


li-tai-po (701-763)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(translated from the chinese by hans bethge)
from das lied von der erde
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by gustav mahler









when sorrow draws near,
wasted lies the gardens of the soul,
withered and dying are joy and song.
dark is life, is death.


(english translation by deryck cooke)

research activities
broadly speaking, my research group is concerned
with the design and implementation of decision
machines. we seek mechanisms that support rational decision making while
taking into account computational and representational practicality. this
objective leads to research in probabilistic reasoning, planning, and knowledge
representation, as well as economics and distributed computation. my research
statement explains this in somewhat greater detail.

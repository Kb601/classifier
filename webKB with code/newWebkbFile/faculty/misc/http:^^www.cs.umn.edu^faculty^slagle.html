build six expert systems.  also, we are researching and designing the
information processing system for the minnesota department of
transportation road research project.  proposed work includes parallel
expert systems, artificial neural networks, temporal (time-based) logic,
reasoning with knowledge representations, and discovering causal knowledge
in large databases.

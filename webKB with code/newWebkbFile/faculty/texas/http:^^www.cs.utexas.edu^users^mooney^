research interests

my current research interests in artificial intelligence are primarily
in the area of machine learning.  they include:

 natural language acquisition: learning parsers, lexicons,
     information extraction, and word sense disambiguation from examples.
 inductive logic programming: learning prolog programs from examples. 
 knowledge-base and theory refinement: automatically modifying rule bases and bayesian networks 
     to fit empirical data.  
 search-control acquisition: learning to improve planning efficiency and quality.
 comparing and combining neural-network and symbolic learning.

summary of research 
i maintain a long-standing interest in functional programming, its potential
for concurrent processing, and its suitability for formal reasoning. in
fall 1995 i am using a functional programming language in teaching a section

of a real microcomputer application. a longer-term project is a book on
functional algorithms.

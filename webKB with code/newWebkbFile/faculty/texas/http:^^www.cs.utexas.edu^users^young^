summary of research

my research activity focuses on the numerical solution of partial
differential equations based on the use of finite difference methods
and on the use of iterative methods to solve associated systems of
linear algebraic equations involving matrices which are very large and
sparse. several computer software packages have been developed based
on this research as part of the itpack project. the research is being
extended to include methods suitable for shared memory and distributed
memory parallel computers. more rapidly convergent iterative methods
based on the use of parallel multilevel procedures are also being
developed.

welcome to markus' home page.

 
 about myself 

i moved from karlsruhe, germany
to seattle in fall 94. for those interested in geography, karlsruhe is
located in the southwest of germany, in the state of baden-w&uuml;rttemberg. i grew up in another
part of that state, in the district of 
 biberach  in upper swabia (oberschwaben).

before coming to the uw i studied computer science at the university of karlsruhe  from which
i obtained a "diplom" (m.s.) in computer science in 1992. 

i also spent one year at umass  as a  fulbright grantee.
my main research interests are parallel and distributed computing,
object-oriented systems and compilers. currently i am working on
  dynamic compilation.

non-cs interests include  spanish  and  latin american culture, 
travel , e.g. to   
good  books, e.g. 

the labyrinth of solitude ,  chess 

non-mainstream movies, eg die
angst des torwarts beim elfmeter  (do you know 
handke?) and  salsa or merengue  dancing with  
and, if there's still time left, i check out what else  to do in seattle. 

more to come..

and a quote: consider the lilies of the field, how they grow:
they toil not, neither do they 
spin; and yet i say unto you, that even solomon in all his glory
was not arrayed like one of these.  matthew 6:28

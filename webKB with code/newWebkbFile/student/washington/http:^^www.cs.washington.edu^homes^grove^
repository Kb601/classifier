 work

i spend most of my time playing with 
cecil. 
cecil is a new pure object-oriented langauge that we are using   
as a vehicle for integrated research in the areas of language design, 
programming environments, and optimizing compilers.  

 i also used to be one of the hordes of consultants hanging around
the fringes of the 
spin
project. now that i'm actually attempting to graduate sometime soonish, i
do this much less frequently. 


  papers i've authored or co-authored.





 play

 the day just wouldn't be complete without a  dilbert
fix. here's a strip that
hits a little too close to home!
  

i am currently managing an  underacheiving 
fantasy football team.  

 i used to spend my summers in new hampshire, working with  these guys at wah-tut-ca scout
reservation (greater
lowell council, bsa).  
here's a picture of a  wah-tut-ca
sunset, taken right from my cabin.  just  for kicks,  here's another one.  

 every once in a while, the boys in my office do  something silly. 
our 
white water rafting trip was especially cool.  

 after spending a few months in toronto, i drove back to
seattle and took a number of detours along the way.  here are some

hihglights from the trip.

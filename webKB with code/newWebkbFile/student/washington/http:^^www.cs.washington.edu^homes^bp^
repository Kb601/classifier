all about brian pinkerton



brian pinkerton

these days, i'm trying to achieve some sort of balance between real
life and work.  outside of work, i ski, paddle kayaks, and coach kids.
it's fun!  every so often, i visit friends in california.  that's fun
too!
           

i'm currently in the department of molecular biotechnology, working on 
algorithms and tools for mapping genes at a coarse level.  my hope is 
to find some interesting computer applications of sufficient research 
interest to computer scientists that i'll be able to earn my phd by 
solving them.

another current interest is the webcrawler, a tool i wrote for finding
information in the web.  in addition to being a great web indexer, it
can act like an agent, and find stuff for you on the web.  if you 
want to find out more about the webcrawler, check out this
description,
or head right over to the
search page.

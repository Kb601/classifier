print yourself

something crazy i did. i didn't even come up with this particular
solution myself, but the implementation was done by me. it's
all on one line and shouldn't contain a trailing carriage return
(384 bytes). compiles without warning with gcc. if you run it,
this program will print it's exact source code. if you can do it
in fewer bytes in c, i'd like to see it!


v(c){putchar(c);}u(char*x){for(;*x;x++)if(*x-92)if(*x-34
)v(*x);else{v(92);v(34);}else{v(92);v(92);}v(92);v(48);}
char x[]={37,115,0};main(){char*b="v(c){putchar(c);}u(ch
ar*x){for(;*x;x++)if(*x-92)if(*x-34)v(*x);else{v(92);v(3
4);}else{v(92);v(92);}v(92);v(48);}char x[]={37,115,0};m
ain(){char*b=\"\0\";printf(x,b);u(b);u(b+=148);printf(x,
b);}\0";printf(x,b);u(b);u(b+=148);printf(x,b);}

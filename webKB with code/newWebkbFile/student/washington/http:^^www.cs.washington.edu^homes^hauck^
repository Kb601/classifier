i'm a 5th year graduate student at the university of washington.
i am currently working on multi-fpga systems and rapid-prototyping of 
board-level designs, though
i am also interested in asynchronous circuits, fpga architectures, and 
parallelism.  i should graduate in june of 1995.

research




 
asynchronous circuits
	 survey of current asynchronous design methodologies, as
	well as the first fpga for asynchronous circuits.

 
triptych/montage fpga architectures
	 development of the triptych and montage fpga 
	architectures, architectures with improved densities over current 
	commercial fpgas.

 

multi-fpga systems & rapid-prototyping
	 development of the springbok rapid-prototyping system for
	board-level designs, as well as partitioning, pin assignment,
	and routing topology work for general multi-fpga systems.

 
the chinook project
	 a hardware/software co-design, co-synthesis, and co-simulation
	system for embedded applications.

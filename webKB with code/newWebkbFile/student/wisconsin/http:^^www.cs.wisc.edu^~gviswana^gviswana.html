 thesis research  
my thesis focuses on the design and implementation of data-parallel
languages. i have been involved in the design of c**, a data-parallel
language (based on c++) developed locally. i have implemented a c**
compiler targeting the cm-5, and am investigating how data-parallel
applications can be executed as efficiently as hand-coded parallel
programs.

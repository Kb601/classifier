link to my senior honors
thesis on general e-unification.




i am the coke poobah

look at my works, ye mighty, and be afraid!!!

oh dear : i've gone and let this new job of being the coke poobah go to
my head.  i'm not usually this far gone.  really.  if you want to talk to
someone who's better adjusted to his crucial role in uw cs dept life, you
should probably see elton.
he doesn't even mention being the co-poobah on his page.  imagine
that.

besides the aforementioned coke poobahship/mental illness, there are a
few other things you might want to know about me.  i'm a third year
graduate student in the cs department at wisconsin, concentrating in
databases, and currently studying for the qual (which will be sometime in
early february).  for exercise and relaxation i play squash (reasonably well) all year round,
ultimate frisbee (ok) in the summer, and basketball, poorly and
infrequently; and if you notice such things, you might see me rapidly
riding my mountain bike around campus -- even in the chilliest of weather,
and always with a helmet.

if you wish to learn more about my interests, feel free to examine my
not-very-often-updated hierarchy of stuff i
like.  enjoy.

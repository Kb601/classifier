jon's home page



welcome to jon's home page!
i'm a first year graduate student at the university of wisconsin, madison, 
studying computer science.  i am a ta for cs 132: using computers.  i 
am also maintaining a faq (frequently 
asked questions) list on the latest powerbook models released by apple 
(the 5300's, the 190's, and the 2300's)


here are a few things to look at:

students in my cs 132 lab sections should 
click here
i've amassed a big list of good web 
sites, in a number of catagories.
check out the web pages for the uw-madison cs department, uw-madison itself, and my alma mater, rpi!
the sites i visit the most often are:

apple's home page -- for all your 
mac needs
the nando 
times  -- for great news coverage
the spot -- for mind-numbing, 
soap-operaish drivel
ziffnet -- for computer industry 
news
cs564: database management systems and  cs 701: construction of compilers -- 
for keeping up with my classwork
today's 
dilbert -- for a bit of a chuckle

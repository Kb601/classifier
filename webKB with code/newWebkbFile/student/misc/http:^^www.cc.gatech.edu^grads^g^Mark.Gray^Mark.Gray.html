research interests:

i have been the head programmer on 
i-observe,
a collection of tools for discovering usability problems by analyzing and 
visualizing
detailed usage logs. the 
usability
engineering program is a group interested in and responsible
for the development of i-observe. some time this quarter i will pass
this project to another lucky student while i look for a job.

i spent the summer of 1994 at 
intel in 
portland, oregon using ideas from
chime
to build i-observe for windows. since then most development work has
moved from the unix/x environment to windows '95.

other group projects i have been involved with include:

 automated layout of dialogue boxes for uide (tech report)
 netvis analyzer 


other interests:

i am clearly an atypical grad student because i spend some time 
outside the lab.

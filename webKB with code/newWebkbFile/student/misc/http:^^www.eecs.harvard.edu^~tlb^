extreme discipline for netscape users
if you run netscape, you need to be disciplined!
caution: do not use if you have epilepsy, high blood pressure, lower back pain, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, carpal tunnel syndrome or other physical ailment, or if you are pregnant or expect to become pregnant in the next six months.
after being disciplined, try this.

duration (seconds - max 5):


high freq ac
low freq ac
dc, cranium negative
dc, cranium positive

2 hz pulsed

(am i in my usual chair? find out here before shocking me)

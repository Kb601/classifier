about me...
i'm a graduate student at the university of california at san diego
in the computer science and engineering department.
my research interests are in:

/computerscience/artificialintelligence/machinelearning/geneticalgorithms

in particular, i'm interested in genetic algorithms containing
models of ontogeny, particularly those in which phrase-structure
grammars are the model of ontogeny of choice.  my work so far
has mainly focused on applying such ga's to the problem of evolving
compare-exchange networks that sort or merge.
more recently, my interests have shifted to broader issues involving
the evolution of grammars, and to other applications of genetic
algorithms containing ontogenetic models.
i am also the current caretaker of gaucsd, a genetic algorithm
package maintained locally.

publications
these still need to be filled in the rest of the way.  sorry for
the inconvenience.

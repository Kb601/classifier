i am a graduate student at the california
institute of technology  
(caltech), studying for my ph.d. in
computer science.  i work in the
scalable concurrent programming (scp)
lab. 
news: along with the entire scp laboratory, i will be moving to 
syracuse university in mid-december.  stay tuned for my new address, phone number, etc.  


current projects


hawk: plasma simulation for microelectronics fabrication
 the scp grid library:  a library for unstructured parallel solvers.

the scp structures library, a 
library for hash tables, linked lists, etc.

research projects

i am a member of the arcadia and
hyperware projects doing research on
next-generation software engineering environments.  my particular emphasis
is on global software engineering environments,
using the web as a medium for international collaboration.

i have been actively involved in the world wide web project for over
three years now.  i set up the original
ics department's www server in 1993,
created several www software packages,
and then became involved in the effort to specify and improve the www
infrastructure (the set of protocols that you used to retrieve and view
this document) through the ietf working
groups on uri, html,
and http.

i am also one of the founding members of the 
apache group, creators of the apache
http server that currently dominates the general-purpose server market.
apache is my favorite example of the power of global collaboration for the
creation of software.

during the summer of 1995, i was a visiting scholar at mit/lcs, working with
tim berners-lee and the world wide web
consortium (w3c).  you can also see my
w3c home.

freely-available software


libwww-perl
a library of perl4 packages which provides a simple and consistent
    programming interface to the world wide web.  this library is being
    developed as a collaborative effort to assist the further development
    of useful www clients and tools.

momspider
a web robot for providing multi-owner maintenance of 
    distributed hypertext infostructures.

wwwstat
a package for analyzing httpd server access logs and providing
    summary statistics in html format.

apache
the best general-purpose http server that money can't buy.


life story

what, you're still reading this?  according to most hypertext research,
you should have become bored by now and moved on to to another page.
well, this is for those who are extra curious (or just have nothing better
to do).

my background is a bit odd: i was conceived in 
new zealand and born in
south laguna,
california. 
although most of my schooling has been in the u.s., i was taught how
to read during a year in 
auckland.
my 
father is an emeritus professor in 
social sciences here at uc irvine,
which is why i have been raised a yank.  i was born in september 1965,
during the first week of classes of the year uci was established, so you
might say that the two of us grew up together.  i am part 
maori,
kiwi,
yank, irish, scottish, british, and california beach bum.  like i
said, a bit odd.


most of the rest can be seen in my vita.

other interests

i like playing games -- especially non-betting card games (bridge,
hearts, etc) and obscure board games (british rails, naval war, etc).
i also like playing basketball, softball, football and going fishing.
mind you, i haven't had time to do any of these things since i started
messing with the web.

quotations


      what is life?  it is the flash of a firefly in the night.
      it is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime.
      it is the little shadow which runs across the grass
      and loses itself in the sunset.

      --- crowfoot's last words (1890), blackfoot warrior and orator.



      to most readers it will be easy, after reading this tale, to accept
      rover's theory that man is set up deliberately as the antithesis of
      everything the dogs stand for, a sort of mythical straw-man, a
      sociological fable.

      this is underlined by the recurring evidence of man's aimlessness,
      his constant running hither and yon, his grasping at a way of life
      which constantly eludes him, possibly because he never knows exactly
      what he wants.

      --- clifford d. simak, "city" [notes on the fifth tale], 1952.



      if i had 2 cents for every time someone offered me their $0.02,
      writing ietf standards would be downright profitable.

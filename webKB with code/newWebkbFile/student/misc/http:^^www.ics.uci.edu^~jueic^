 research area: 

i am currently a ph.d. candidate in information and computer science.
my dissertation is in the area of specification-based software
testing.  in particular, my focus is on using formal specifications to
derive test cases that can be used to test the specified program.  i
have developed a rule-based approach for deriving test cases from
axiomatic languages (languages based on predicate logic; z and anna
are examples of axiomatic specification languages) and applied it to a
formal specification language called the  assertion
definition language (adl).

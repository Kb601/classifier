 dcc-ufmg-brazil. 


  finger info  (updated whenever i log in) 


 a short history of my research interests: 

my first scientific experience dates back to 1991, when i studied the
dynamics of elliptic billiards, under the supervision of prof.
s&ograve;nia de carvalho, in the 
math department of ufmg . after that, i worked for about three
years with machine learning and parallel and distributed computing,
being advised by  prof.
m&aacute;rcio de carvalho , in the  cs
department of ufmg . those were basically my junior and senior
years, as well as the first year of my studies towards an msc degree in
brazil. in the last six months of my enrollment as a student at ufmg, i
also worked with dextrous manipulation, still under the supervision of
prof.  m&aacute;rcio, but then being also co-advised by  prof. m&aacute;rio campos .
if you speak portuguese, you can check the list of my publications
during this period in  my
home page in brazil .

finally, since i started my studies towards a phd in rochester,
i've been supervised by  prof. chris brown .
the general area of my current research is computer vision. more
specifically, i'm interested in (robust) pose estimation algorithms for
model-based vision and in approaches for combining different time
series predictors like kalman and lattice filters. recently, i've
been also co-advised by 
prof. helder ara&uacute;jo , who stayed in rochester for one year, 
as a visiting researcher.  


 (some of) my other academic activities: 

 csc 240 

i'm currently serving as a teaching assistant for  prof. dana ballard , in
the course 
``the computational brain'' . among other activities, we
have a sort of weekly writing contest about different aspects of
neuroscience and neural computation. i bet you'll enjoy reading some of
the 
``csc 240's best papers of the week'' .  


 my non-academic life: 

well, i sincerely hope that i can find some free time and inspiration
to write something decent here pretty soon, or otherwise i will end up
being barbecued by my fellas of the  ``amig&atilde;o's
club'' .  pega leve heim galera: apelou, perdeu! ;-)

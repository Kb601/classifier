wow, you're the visitor no 
since november 14, 1996.




welcome to my home page. 

i am a first year graduate student at johns hopkins university.

i don't look like in the previous picture. to be honest, i don't have any
intention to.

if i had had more spare time, i would have figured out
by now which are my research interests. probably they'll come a little
later, together &nbsp;with the rest.&nbsp;anyway, i did waste my time studying:



artificial intelligence 

artificial intelligence 

speech recognition 

it seems that i'm switching to nlp


because i&nbsp;have to do something to justify my existence,
i am the ta for the object oriented system course &nbsp;(goto object
oriented systems page) .

 hi, 
i obtained my b.sc (hons) in math, first class,   from

     national university of singapore (nus), 
and m.sc
from 
 
insititute of system science, 
nus.
presently, i'm a graduate student in nyu under the scholarship from

     computational science program, 
 nus.

 research interests 
algorithms, complexity theory, computational geometry?
 interested in algorithmics
aspect of any problem. currently looking into 
 foveated images .

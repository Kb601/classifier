 research interests 

i am a ph.d. student in the
computer science department
of
the johns hopkins university 
doing research in computer vision under
dr. lawrence b. wolff.
although our computer vision lab is most famous for its work in the field
of polarization vision, i have to admit that i didn't contribute anything
to this fame.  i chose to be among those that will demonstrate
that the jhu computer vision lab is good in all the topics in which it does research. my personal research evolves around the exploitation of photometric invariants in stereo, "3-d stereo using photometric ratios," tech-report 1993.10 and in object recognition "a curvature based invariant for object recognition derived from covariance of photometric values," tech-report 1995.12.





 personal : 

 origin: greek - that explains the unpronouncable last name.
 dog   :  phrini (after high demand i created
a home page for her)
 computer  poetry 
  chocolate on www 
   my philosophy on chocolate (spoken by counselor troi) 



 my favorite websites: 

 cadbury's, the chocolate, the taste 
 the official moon pie page
 the m&m studio 



 publications : 
well, since i am a doctorate candidate, i guess i have to show that i have published something.

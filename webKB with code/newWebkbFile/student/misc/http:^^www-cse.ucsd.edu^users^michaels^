welcome to my home page!



i'm a computer science grad student here at ucsd, working on my master's 
degree.  i come originally from  edmonton, alberta, canada, but i've been here in california for a good while now, as i did my undergrad at harvey mudd college in claremont, california.  


research


i have been working at the san diego
 supercomputer center since march of 1995.  initially i was working on
sdsc's vrml browser, webview, for which i implemented the network support. over the last several 
 months i implemented sdsc's vrml behavior system, vrbs, 
which was demonstrated at the vrml behavior
  workshop in october, and at supercomputing 95 and vrml 95 in december. this   
year i am working on my master's thesis, vizwiz, a java applet for 
interactive scientific visualization on the web.

you can find out more about these projects below.

during 1993 and 1994, i worked on  genetic algorithms for combinatorial
optimization with 
 kihong park . here are our related papers:    

 
 
       on the effectiveness of genetic search in combinatorial optimization 
	(bu-cs-tr 94-010) (868k) 	presented at  10th acm symposium on applied
computing, genetic 	algorithms and optimization track,  february 1995.   

 scalability problems of genetic search. 	in  ieee international

hobbies?  (yea, right)   
lately, i've been spending some time on lake winnipesaukee, in
meredith, nh. check out

readings in the lake.
in my copious free time i like to 
  juggle  and ride my bike.
in the summer of 1994, i got really ambitious and did my first loaded
bicycle tour. i went on  bikecentennial's glacier-waterton loop in beautiful
downtown montana. we climbed logan pass, went on to waterton park in canada and
back to whitefish. for picture click

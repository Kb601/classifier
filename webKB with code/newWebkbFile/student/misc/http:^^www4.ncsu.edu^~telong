        my undergraduate studies were completed at 
         east carolina university.  i 
           spent several years hiding out here.   much to my dismay, 
           graduation day came and i had to enter the real world.
    
  
  
    
       
          
       during my undergraduate studies and for 5 years after graduation, i 
          worked at nortel.  i made some
          great friends here while building experience as a software engineer 
          and unix tool developer.
    
  
  
    
                                           
        i worked at bsg in a 
           very fast-paced and cutting-edge environment until i decided to go 
           back to school full-time. i specialized in graphical user interface design and 
           object-oriented development using c++/motif.
           it was a great job, but i wanted to complete my degree and now 
           seems like the best time.
    
  
  
    
       
          
       i now work as a teaching assistant for 
          
          csc517 - object-oriented languages and systems.
          since going back to school, i feel like i 
          once again have control of my destiny and that i'm making progress on 
          the things that are important to me.  i am 
          working on an mcs degree in the department of computer science at 
       ncsu.

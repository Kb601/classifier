research


i am currently persuing my

ph.d. in computing science at the

university of alberta, researching learning and computation in
connectionist
(or "neural") networks.  i am jointly supervised by
dr. t. anthony marsland,
department of computing science and
dr michael r.w.
dawson, department of psychology
(adjunct appointment, computing science).

i work in the
biological
computation project, an interdisciplinary lab coordinated by dr. michael
dawson, bringing together researchers from computing science, psychology and
philosophy.  i am also associated with the
artificial
intelligence research group in the department of computing science and
am a member of the international neural
network society.

areas of interest guiding my work include:


connectionist systems and biologically inspired models of computation

operations research & markov processes, esp. with regard to probabilistic
learning

artificial intelligence

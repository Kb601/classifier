being a member of zeta phi 
beta sorority inc.







check out the homepage for the  zeta's of psi epsilon

i am currently a graduate student in the area of 



computer science.  although at times life can get hectic,

the  two sites that i enjoy most are those that 

take me to job opportunities available in 

raleigh, north carolina

upon graduation.





there are so many different sites to be visited on the web, these are just a few

that i found quite interesting:





professional sites:

   what's new with ibm

   what's new with my favorite long distance company, at&t!

   mci, what do you have to offer?

   what do sprint and candice bergman have to offer?

   what's new with the fortune 500

personal sites:

   my favorite sport of all, volleyball!!

  are you a jazz fan like i am?

  alright for the black information network!!

  nothing like a good  soap opera in the middle of the day. 

  anyone know where i can get a cheap airline ticket?



miscellaneous sites:

  check out sports on  espn

  does anyone love to watch figure skating! as much as i do?

  one of my favorite female comedians is roseanne

  there's nothing like watching an exhilarating game of  wheel of fortune

  hey, do you want to see a true indians fan?

research interests
my research interests include object-oriented databases and
persistent programming languages.
 links listed here belong to several different categories:

literature search
various interesting groups and projects
other research-related links
programming

 i am currently working on the database programming language for

tigukat objectbase management system. these are the (desired)
properties of the language:

strong static typing with the possibility of dynamic typing
well-defined semantics
self-reflection
flexible and possibly user-definable syntax
tight integration with the database. this includes
 
 orthogonality of type and persistence
 integrated query language
 ability to operate with and invoke code stored in the database
 view description mechanism
 transaction support
 

here
is a set of slides that represents an overview of the system.

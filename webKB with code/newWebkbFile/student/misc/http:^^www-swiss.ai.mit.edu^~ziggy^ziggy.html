        my doctoral research - descartes
 

my 
     
     
        doctoral dissertation research
     
     

is on dynamically adaptive profile-driven program specialization.  i have
been building a prototype system which i call descartes.  the name is a
corruption of the initials for dynamically adaptive

  
  
    scheme
  
  

compiler and run-time execution specializer. my

  
  
    thesis advisor
  
  

is fond of describing it as a self-aware compiler and run-time system.



my thesis defense is scheduled for the end of this term (april 1996).

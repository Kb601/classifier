my personality is split between being an employee of
sandia national laboratories and
being a ph.d. student at unm.


at work i'm involved with the
sunmos/puma
project. if you are interested in a small, scalable, performance oriented,
and unique operating system, then you should have a look at our work.


at unm, herr doktor professor
barney maccabe is my advisor.


i got my funny sounding name and accent in
switzerland where i
grew up. my last name is pronounced just like the english word
reason, while my first name is pronounced with an open "o", as
in roll.

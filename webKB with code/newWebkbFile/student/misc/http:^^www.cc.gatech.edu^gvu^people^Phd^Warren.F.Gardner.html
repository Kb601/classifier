warren gardner




warren is a phd student working in the image understanding lab
at georgia tech.  his research interests include computer vision
and robotics.  his dissertation is concerned with constructing
robust motion interpretation algorithms for complex environments.
an example of some of his work is an algorithm capable of
robust motion interpretation using

line correspondences.
he has also recently worked on the

arpa image database and an on-line version of the 

1994 arpa image understanding workshop.



in his free time warren enjoys training in the martial arts
(wing chun kung fu, muay thai, and bando),
riding his motorcycle, and camping.
he can often be found working in his brother's office
at hofstra university.

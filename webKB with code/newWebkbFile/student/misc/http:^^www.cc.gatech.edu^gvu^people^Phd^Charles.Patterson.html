       education
    

   

    i'm a phd student in the
    graphics, visualization, and usability center
    of the
    college of computing

    at the
    georgia institute of technology.
 
    i received my b.s. in computer science from
    baylor university
    in
    1989 and an m.s. in information and computer science from
    georgia tech
    in 1990.
  
   

    
       research
    

   

    my official research interest is photo-realism in computer graphics -
    particularly, how to render complex environments in a
    feasible amount of time.  this has lead to the thesis proposal 
    "the efficient
       rendering of synthetic images using primitive hierarchies."

    i co-authored a paper in this area - 
    "geometric
       simplification for indirect illumination calculations."
   
   

    
       other interests
    

   

    in my spare time, i like to write and perform music.  i play
    guitar mostly; but i also like to compose on keyboards, using a mac for
    sequencing and a proteus for sampled play back.  i am currently band-less!

    

    i also play and design (but mostly play) video games.  lots and lots of video games.
    soon, my group and i will release a  "total conversion" for doom ii called "strain"
    complete with new graphics, sounds, music, levels, enemies, weapons, etc.  i will
    post more when it is closer to ready!
  
    
  
    i'm also keeping a list of 
    products
    you won't know how you lived without.
   
    
  
    finally, i refuse to have a "list of urls i recommend" section; but,
    my brother, for some reason,
    likes to keep a "list of urls my brother recommended" section, so i guess
    that's just as good.  (this may be broken right now.)

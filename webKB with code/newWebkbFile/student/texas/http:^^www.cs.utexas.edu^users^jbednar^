research  
my research concentrates on biologically realistic modeling of
cognitive processes using artificial neural networks.  i seek to use
the dramatic advances in computing technology over the past few
decades to make equally dramatic advances in our understanding of the
human mind.  with the computing power now available and soon to be
available, realistic simulations of cortical processing are becoming
practical.  this enables us to make (and, if necessary, refute)
testable hypotheses about brain function.  the overall goal is to make
cognitive research into an empirical science, rather than the purely
philosophical domain it has been for centuries.


my master's thesis, ``tilt aftereffects in a self-organizing model of
the primary visual cortex'', is nearly complete.  the abstract:


	visual illusions and aftereffects have long been studied by
	psychologists and vision researchers because these apparent functional
	failures might offer insight into how visual processing is carried out
	by the brain.  a particular class of visual illusions called tilt
	illusions and tilt aftereffects are thought to arise in the primary
	visual cortex of humans, and thus serve as test cases for theories
	about that area of the brain.  specifically, several researchers have
	proposed that they result from lateral inhibition between neurons
	receiving visual input. 

		

	the thesis examines tilt illusions and aftereffects in 
	
	rf-lissom (sirosh and miikkulainen, 1995), a self-organizing model 
	of the primary visual cortex that incorporates such lateral interactions.  
	it is demonstrated that the self-organizing principles driving rf-lissom
	result in aftereffects which are qualitatively and quantitatively
	similar to those measured in humans.  on the basis of these results,
	a new explanation for so-called ``indirect effects'' (interactions
	between lines with very different orientations) is proposed in the
	thesis.  the self-organizing model should also apply to other figural
	aftereffects, such as spatial frequency aftereffects, which we predict
	result from the same lateral interaction processes.


a preliminary report of the research is available as 
a postscript file.  i am also beginning my doctoral research,
which will include further simulations of detailed low-level visual
behavior, using an extension of the rf-lissom model.

 intro 

welcome to the home page of subramanyam gooty (as the bold name at the 
start suggests). continue on reading to get to know me ( hopefully u wont 
be disappointed ).





 old is gold 


well i was born on sept 1 1973 (somebody interested) in 
 hyderabad .
this place is in 
 andhra pradesh 
(for people interested in geography) a southern state in 
 india. 
for the people who are curious to know about my 
 family.


after schooling, i joined  osmania university, 
 college of technology  
for my bachelor's in chemical engineering. came into contact with people 
from varying background and thoughts. made a lot of friends. we were always 
proud to call ourselves 
 the batch of 1990-94 . 


then in 1994 came over to usa to 
 university of nebraska-lincoln .
had a great gala time there. it was there that i became addicted to 
american football. except for the cold winter every thing else was
just great. studied there for one year in computer science before 
i transferred over to university of texas-austin.



 life's on ... 


now i am presently enrolled in the masters program in the
  computer science department  of 
 university of texas-austin. austin is a real 
cool place to hang around. i especially like the 
 weather 
out here.



here in austin also i have made a lot of friends (as usual)
. here are some of the fun loving and acad caring people 
(i listed this out in alphabetical order. so no ........)



 abraham 

 gokul 

 kumar 

 mehul 

 neeraj 

 shantanu 

 shailesh  

 vipin  




 as i like it ... 


one of the things i like the best is to keep on chatting to friends
(i know many of u out there know it !). i also like making new friends
, travelling around. playing games is another one. i play games like
chess (any questions), carrom board, racquet ball, tennis, table tennis
, cricket, soccer .... and on and on. i love watching 
 nba games .

 i like to read some books (not definetly text books). want to check 
my horoscope for today. check out ur compatabile love signs.
i also like to listen to old hindi songs. 
well there is a lot more to write but i would not like to bore you and 
also narrow down my options of some one liking me!!





 golden future 


it goes without saying that "man controls his destiny". so what ever 
success i have in my life will of course be attributed to my 
"hardwork", "wil power" and  all good things. if some thing bad happens 
we can always say "man proposes and god disposes....". 


please spend some time to fill in some valuable comments

business

my resume (postscript).

in spring 1996 i had to give a report to my
	ee382c ("software for highly-available distributed
	systems") class.  the slides talk about
	efforts to use
	
	rt-mach to implement some of 
	
	flaviu cristian's distributed
	algorithms (work done for 
	
	prof. al mok; built on some work by 
	guangtian liu).

i am currently working on a hardware verification project at 
ibm in the
rs/6000 division.
it ties in with my ph.d research under professor 
allen emerson.


pleasure

domestic bliss department:  
	photos of my wife carla and our newborn
	daughter ruth claire (3/13/96).

before parenthood struck, travel and beer were high priorities.
        somewhere between the two lies the enjoyment i get from peeling
	beer labels off of bottles in foreign
	lands.


humor from various sources

the 
	sofasphere ii project.
some haikus about olestra, the new
	fda-approved fat substitute.
speaking of poetry... here is an interesting ode to 
	women.
some disinformation about 
	bob dole.

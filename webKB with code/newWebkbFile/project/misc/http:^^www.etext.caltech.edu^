the caltech archetypes / etext project





the caltech archetypes/etext project combines work in two areas:

 an investigation of programming archetypes,
	where 
	a programming archetype (briefly) is an abstraction from
	a class of programs with a common structure and includes
	class-specific design strategies
	and a collection of example program designs and implementations.
 an experimental electronic textbook, with content based on
	the idea of programming archetypes.

or
etext@cs.caltech.edu.









 overview 


	the paper concurrent program archetypes
	(.html
	or .ps),
	delivered as the keynote address of the 1994
	international parallel processing symposium,
	gives an overview of
	what an archetype is and how it can be used. 




 prototype archetype implementations 


	we have developed a collection of 
	
	prototype archetype implementations,
	each containing documentation and program code.




 archetype applications 


	we have developed several
	
	archetype-based applications.




 the electronic textbook  


	we have a collection of 
	prototype chapters
	for an electronic textbook based on archetypes.

	most of these chapters were initially developed using a
	next-based authoring tool called the
	etext engine.




 related papers and student projects 


	we also have a collection of
	papers and student projects
	about archetypes and the electronic textbook.




 useful links 


	here
	is a collection of useful links -- related projects,
	textbooks, bibliographies, etc.




 repositories of code and documentation 


	much program code is available via
	anonymous ftp from etext.caltech.edu,
	as noted in individual documentation.

	postscript versions of many of the html documents are also
	available via anonymous ftp from etext.caltech.edu.
	they are collected in this
	repository.

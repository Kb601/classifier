digital design derivation 
 digital design derivation 



description:  

this research adapts a formal programming methodology to the construction of
 digital systems.
an algebra for manipulating modeling expressions is used to reduce
 higher-level specifications of behavior to structures mapping directly
 into vlsi technologies.
this work links a large body of research in program refinement---to
 which this department has been a significant contributor---with
 other formal methods as applied to digital design.

a principal goal of this research has been to establish
 algebraic derivation as a mode of formal verification.
the tendency in  formal methods research  toward deductive proofs
 of correctness does not reflect design practice.
our central thesis is that effective automated reasoning in design
 must provide well-integrated support of a variety of reasoning systems.
hence, a task of this project is to develop an algebraic formalism that is
 on a par, mathematically and mechanically, with contemporary deductive systems.
a large component of our research activity has to do with the the
 implementation of the ddd algebra, its integration with cad tools and other
 formal systems, and the application these tools to realistic design problems.

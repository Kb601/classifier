persistent linda 
a software system for robust distributed/parallel computing.
want to write to us?




objectives
the objectives of the plinda project are two-fold:

fault tolerant parallel computing
	    - provide language
   	   constructs that facilitate
   	   the design of high performance fault-tolerant parallel programs.

harness the aggregate power of idle cycles on networks 
	   of workstations in a manner that is fault-tolerant and does 
	   not disturb the owners of the workstations at all.
	   our system models non-idleness (e.g. user returns
  	   to workstation) as failure.
	   the work being done at the idle workstation is then moved.


applications
the major class of plinda applications are long-running coarse grain parallel applications.

example applications:

nile project
data mining (eg. biological pattern discovery)



distribution

source code is available!
and here is how to install it.
please refer to the plinda user manual for 
additional information.



faq


future work

debuggers and run-time visualization tools.
software tools for writing parallel/distributed programs.
performance improvements for scientific applications.
programming tools for data mining.
a distributed run-time kernel for plinda.
suggestions -- please feel free to send mail to plinda@cs.nyu.edu.

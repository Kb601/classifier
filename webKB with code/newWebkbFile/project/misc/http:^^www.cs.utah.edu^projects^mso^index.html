nature of work

the mach shared objects project is an effort to apply object-oriented
techniques to the problems of operating systems interface and
implementation, language implementations, and storage techniques.
these areas are covered by a variety of software components and
theoretical groundwork which operate in concert to enhance existing
technonogies.



     omos -
	 an object/meta-object server

     omos is an active object server which manages executable
	 programs and their components as a set of composable objects.
	 besides replacing the traditional services of a linker, omos
	 is able to provide dynamic object loading, shared libraries,
	 program analysis, and custom application construction.

     the object manager

     the object manager provides a centralized service for
	 storing, retrieving, and naming object instances and the
	 meta-objects.  this provides the services commonly attributed
	 to a persistent object data manager.

     a general object-oriented
	 framework for interface expression

     goofie is a meta-object generator capable of creating
	 portable object descriptions.  these meta-objects are used to
	 store and retrieve objects, marshal and unmarshal arguments
	 to function calls and provide a ``platform'' for univeral
	 polymorphism in the c++ programming language.

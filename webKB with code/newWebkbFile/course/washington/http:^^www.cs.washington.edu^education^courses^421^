about file formats:  most of the
course materials above are provided in three formats:





  latex:
    plain ascii text including formating commands.
    simple things (e.g. assignments) are generally quite legible in
    this format.  for figures and complex math stuff, these are
    hard-to-impossible to read.
  adobe acrobat  :
    the latest &amp; greatest.
    get a free viewer from adobe's 
    acrobat and the web page.
    
  postscript:
    the 
    ghostscript home page
    has free viewers (mac, windows, os/2, linux, ...)
  
at this time, acrobat is supported on fewer systems, but is
preferable if you can use it -- files are smaller, rendering is
faster and more legible, and it can print (which mac ghostscript
can't, for example).

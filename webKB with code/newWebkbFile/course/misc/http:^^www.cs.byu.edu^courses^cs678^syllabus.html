cs 678 syllabus - fall '94















cs678 - syllabus 

since cs678 is a research course tailored to the needs of the current
students enrolled, there is no set syllabus.  following is a list of the
topics which we covered indepth in the first cs678 offering.
 


 extended asocs coverage
 hamming networks
 learning by a critic and the associate search network
 genetic algorithms
 self organizing topological feature maps
 counterpropagation networks
 bam's (bidirectional associative memories)
 boolean networks
 how to write journal/conference research papers.  each student was
required to write a journal style research paper.  this paper was not
necessarily to be published  (a couple were), but to give them the
experience of writing a careful research publication.
 rce's (restricted coloumb energy networks)
 implementation of actual applications in neural networks

course description:
		
                 
graduate-level introduction to computer graphics algorithms,
programming methods, and applications. the primary focus is on the
fundamentals of two- and three-dimensional raster graphics:
scan-conversion, clipping, geometric transformations, and camera
modeling.  basic concepts in computational geometry, computer-human
interfaces, animation, and visual realism are also introduced.
graphics techniques are taught in a device independent manner.

runs in parallel with the undergraduate introduction to graphics
class, cs480.  in addition to
attending cs480 lectures and doing the
programming projects, graduate students get together for one hour a
week to discuss recent journal/conference papers from the field. 
for a list of readings, see the cs680 syllabus.

                
final programming project: 
                  
graduate students are not required to take the mid-term quiz or final
exam; instead, they will produce a final programming project.  by
mid-term, each cs680 student is expected to write a one page
description of their proposed final programming project.  ideally, the
project will implement and analyze a research paper, or it can utilize
graphics to solve a specific problem relevant to the graduate
student's own research.  the projects will be evaluated based on both
a demo of a working system and a written report.

      an optimal
     backtrack algorithm for tree-structured constraint satisfaction
     problems.  artificial intelligence 71(1), 159-181, 1994.

     presents a top-down algorithm for solving tree-structured
     constraint satisfaction problems in linear time and evaluates its 
     average-case performance empirically.

      using csp look-back
     techniques to solve exceptionally hard sat instances.
     in  proc. of the second int'l conf. on principles
     and practice of constraint programming (lecture notes in computer 
     science 1118) , 46-60, springer, 1996.

     csp look-back techniques (cbj, learning), not widely used in
     existing sat algorithms, turn out to be indispensable for solving
     instances which are "exceptionally hard". a new procedure
     we define generates such instances consistently.

      a complexity analysis of space-bounded learning algorithms for the 
     constraint satisfaction problem.
     in  proc. of the 13th national conf. on artificial
     intelligence,  298-304, 1996. 

     analyzes the effects of space-bounded learning 
     (a.k.a. constraint-recording) schemes on the runtime complexity of 
     backtrack search.

      on the space-time 
     trade-off in solving constraint satisfaction problems.
     in  proc. of the 14th int'l joint conf. on 
     artificial intelligence, 558-562, 1995.

     from the perspective of achieving tractable constraint satisfaction
     by	restricting constraint graph structure, extensive use of space may
     be of limited benefit.    ijcai95.ps.z

     with artificial intelligence,  18-25, ieee press, 1994. 

     describes a purely declarative method for introducing modularity into 
     forward-chaining rule-based languages, and its embodiment in the
     syntax of the venus rule language.

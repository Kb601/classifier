lisp / x drawing demo
drawing program using interactive x graphics in lisp

this is a demo of the draw program distributed with the
x interface for gnu common lisp
which is available as free software under the gnu general public license
from  ftp.ma.utexas.edu 

when the demo is started, a drawing window is created.
two menus are presented: a menu of drawing items and a menu of commands.
select drawing items and then click the mouse one or more times inside
the drawing area.

the make latex command can be used to create latex commands
to produce the drawing.  latex mode will restrict lines to
lines that latex can draw.  note, however, that latex cannot produce all
the things that can be drawn.  the latex code is served to you in a file
that is presented after the program terminates.

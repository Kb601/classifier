 protocol theory 



we investigated the semantics of basic concepts essential to the
design and specification of protocols, such as these questions:  
what is meant by protocol  a 
being an abstraction of protocol   b ?  what is meant by protocol   b 
being a refinement of protocol   a ?  
answers to these questions gave rise to methods that facilitate 
the design of nontrivial, multi-function protocols.  
our current research focus is on understanding interface semantics between 
modules that are service providers and consumers.  we make use of such understanding 
to develop decomposition and composition methods for protocol engineering.

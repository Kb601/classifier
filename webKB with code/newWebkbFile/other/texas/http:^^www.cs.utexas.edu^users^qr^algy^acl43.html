running allegro cl v4.3



 how to load and run allegro common lisp (v4.3)

these instructions pertain to the installation at the university
of texas but, except for the file paths, should also be applicable
to other installations.




setup
allegro common lisp v4.3 is available on both the ibm machines running
aix and the sun machines running solaris.  the setup for both machines
is exactly the same.

if you want to run lisp from the unix shell, type acl.
the binary is in the directory /lusr/bin.

however, the best way to run lisp is as a subprocess of emacs.
to do this you need to make some changes to your ".emacs"
file and to your lisp initialization file, ".clinit.cl".

setting up your unix environment

put /lusr/bin in your path variable.

setting up the ".emacs" file
add the following lines to the file (by the way, "fi" stands for
"franz incorporated"):


(setq load-path (cons "/lusr/lib/franz/acl4.3/home/emacs/fi" load-path))
(autoload 'fi:common-lisp "fi-site-init" "" t)
(setq fi:common-lisp-image-name "acl")


setting up the ".clinit.cl" file
at the end of the file, place the line:


(start-emacs-lisp-interface)


the documentation claims that the emacs-lisp interface starts automatically, but i
find that it doesn't.

starting lisp
do the command:  m-x fi:common-lisp




running allegro common lisp
the acl shell accepts a set of commands.  for example, :ld  loads
a file.
here is a list of acl commands.  also,
the allegro emacs-lisp interface defines a set of emacs commands to manipulate
files and program components.  type ctrl-h m in a lisp mode buffer
to list the available commands.

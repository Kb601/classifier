 the robotics manipulator used for our research is a commercial
robotics manipulator from rhino robots inc. it is a xr-4 arm driven by
a mark iv controller. the xr-4 are 5 axis revolute corrdinate robot
arms with a motor driven gripper. it can be extended up to 22.5 inches
and lift weight up to 4.0 lbs. 


  all its axes are controlled by dc servo motors using incremental
optical encoders for feedback and contain limit switches which are
used to position the arm to a hardware (known) home position



(extracted from rhino: the xr-3, xr-4 and scara manual).

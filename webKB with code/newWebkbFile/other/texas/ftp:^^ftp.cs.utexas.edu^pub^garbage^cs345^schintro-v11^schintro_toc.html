introduction

what is scheme? (hunk a)
basic scheme features

code consists of expressions

parenthesized prefix expressions
expressions return values, but may have side-effects
defining variables and procedures
most operators are procedures
definitions vs. assignments
special forms
control structures are expressions

the boolean values #t and #f
some other control-flow constructs: cond, and, and or

cond
and and or

comments (hunk c)
a note about parentheses and indenting

let your editor help you
indenting procedure calls and simple control constructs
indenting cond
indenting procedure definitions

all values are pointers to objects

all values are pointers
implementations optimize away pointers
objects on the heap

scheme reclaims memory automatically
objects have types, variables don't

dynamic typing

the empty list (hunk e)

pairs and lists

cdr-linked lists
lists and quoting
where the empty list got its name

recursion over lists and other data structures
type and equality predicates (hunk g)

type predicates
equality predicates
choosing equality predicates  (hunk i)

quoting and literals

simple literals and self-evaluation

local variables and lexical scope

let

indenting let expressions

lexical scope

binding environments and binding contours
block structure diagrams for lets

let*

procedures (hunk k)

procedures are first class
higher-order procedures
anonymous procedures and lambda
lambda and lexical scope (hunk m)
local definitions
recursive local procedures and letrec
multiple defines are like a letrec
variable arity: procedures that take a variable number of arguments
apply

variable binding again

identifiers and variables
variables vs. bindings vs. values

tail recursion (hunk o)
macros
continuations
iteration constructs
discussion and review

using scheme (a tutorial)

an interactive programming environment  (hunk b)

starting scheme
making mistakes and recovering from them
returns and parentheses
interrupting scheme
exiting (quitting) scheme
trying out more expressions
booleans and conditionals
sequencing
other flow-of-control structures

using cond
using and and or

making some objects (hunk d)
lists (hunk f)

using predicates (hunk h)

using type predicates
using equality predicates

local variables, let, and lexical scope (hunk j)
using first-class, higher-order, and anonymous procedures (hunk l)

first-class procedures
using and writing higher-order procedures

interactively changing a program (hunk n)

replacing procedure values
loading code from a file
loading and running whole programs

some other useful data types

strings
symbols

a note on identifiers

lists again

heterogeneous lists
operations on lists


basic programming examples (hunk p)

an error signaling routine
length
copying lists
append and reverse

append
reverse

map and for-each

map
for-each

member and assoc, and friends

member, memq, and memv
assoc, assq, and assv


procedural abstraction

procedure specialization
procedure composition
currying

a simple scheme compiler

what is a compiler?

what is an interpreter?
ok, so what's a compiler?

what does a compiler generate?
basic structure of the compiler
data representations, calling convention, etc.

continuations

applying a procedure doesn't save the caller's state

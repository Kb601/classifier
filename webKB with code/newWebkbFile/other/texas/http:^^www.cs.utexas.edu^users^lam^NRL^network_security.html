 network security



to enhance the security of networked systems, we proposed a security 
architecture together with novel protocols for authentication, 
called texas authentication protocols (taps), and a new language 
for authorization, called generalized access control list (gacl).  
a proof methodology for verifying authentication protocols based upon
state transition semantics has been developed.  a high level abstraction
for secure network programming (snp), designed to resemble a socket interface,
has been implemented.

gnu manuals 
 
last updated 09/25/96


all gnu manauls are available in postscript or pdf (portable document format).  
most manuals range from 150-250 printed pages, so i recommend you view them under 
ghostview (for postscript) or adobe acrobat reader (for pdf), and 
selectively print those sections you need. 

you can order bound manuals from the free software foundation.
the emacs manual is $25.00, and includes a fold-out reference card. 
gnu emacs is also described in an o'reilly nutshell book, available from
your favorite bookstore (ut co-op, bookstop, borders, barnes&noble, etc.)

the gnu debugger reference card is a useful thing to print off (2 pages landscape mode) and carry
with you. you can order a nice fold-out card for $10.00 (!) from fsf.

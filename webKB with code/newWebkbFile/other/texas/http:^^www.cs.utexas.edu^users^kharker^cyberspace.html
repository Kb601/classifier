ken harker - 
cyberspace advocacy




i am a member of the association for computing
machinery, and i have been a member of the 
electronic frontier foundation when my finances permitted.  i support many 
of the ideas espoused by the league for programming freedom, although i am not 
a member.  i try to be as actively involved in promoting civil liberties in 
cyberspace as my spare time allows.  i am a strong supporter of free, strong, 
and open public key encryption.  ask me about pgp 
(pretty good privacy) encryption.

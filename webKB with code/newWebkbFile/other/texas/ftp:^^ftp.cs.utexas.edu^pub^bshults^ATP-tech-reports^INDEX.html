abstract: in this paper, we describe the rules of the set-var prover, which
is an extension of resolution, and which handles theorems in a subset of 
second order logic. we also give example proofs using the system, and
show that the rules are sound.  and we conjecture that the prover is complete
for a certain extension of first order logic which includes many of the
theorems of real analysis.  this system is based on an earlier "set variable"
prover, implemented in natural deduction.

 a precondition prover for analogy
                   
w.w. bledsoe 
computer science department 
the university of texas at austin 
austin, texas 78712


we describe here a prover pc that normally acts as an ordinary theorem
prover, but which returns a ``precondition'' when it is unable to
prove the given formula.  if f is the formula attempted to be
proved and pc returns the precondition q, then (q -->
f) is a theorem (that pc can prove).  this prover, pc, uses a
proof-plan.  in its simplest mode, when there is no
proof-plan, it acts like ordinary abduction. we show here how
this method can be used to derive certain proofs by analogy.
to do this, it uses a proof-plan from a given guiding proof
to help construct the proof of a similar theorem, by ``debugging''
(automatically) that proof-plan.

we show here the analogy proofs of a few simple example theorems and
one hard pair, ex4 and ex4l.  the given proof-plan for ex4 is used by
the system to prove automatically ex4; and that same proof-plan is
then used to prove ex4l, during which the proof-plan is ``debugged''
(automatically).  these two examples are similar to two other, more
difficult, theorems from the theory of resolution, namely gcr
(the ground completeness of resolution) and gclr (the ground
completeness of lock resolution).  gcr and and gclr have also been
handled, in essence, by this system but not completed in all their
details.

this paper describes an implementation of the set-var proof
procedure [1].  te program itself, found in the file, set-var.lisp,
is written in lisp and attempts to prove theorems in fol-s a certain 
extension of first-order logic (see below).  a call to (set-var thm) 
causes it to attempt to automatically prove the theorem, thm.  
even though we believe that set-var is complete for fol-s, we know that 
this implementation is not, because we have made several restrictions
(see below) in order to speed up the search.  but we believe that 
it still retains most of the generality of set-var itself.

     using set-var to prove the heine borel theorem

theorem (heine-borel).  if g is a family of open sets on the real line
        which cover the closed interval [a,b], then some finite subset
        h of g also covers [a,b].

abstract. 

we give here a pair of theorems that we hope to use in our analogy
theorem proving experiments.  they both are heine-borel theorems,
the first for the real line, r1, and the second for two dimensional
real space, r2.  the basic idea is to use a proof of the first as
a guide to produce (automatically) a proof of the second.  we have 
not yet produced such an automatic proof;  we give these examples
and the information below, only as material for proceeding with
the analogy process.

the creation and use of a knowledge base 
of mathematical theorems and definitions

ipr is an automatic theorem-proving system intended particularly for
use in higher-level mathematics.  it discovers the proofs of theorems
in mathematics applying known theorems and definitions.  theorems and
definitions are stored in the knowledge base in the form of sequents
rather than formulas or rewrite rules.  because there is more
easily-accessible information in a sequent than there is in the
formula it represents, a simple algorithm can be used to search the
knowledge base for the most useful theorem or definition to be used in
the theorem-proving process.  this paper describes how the sequents in
the knowledge base are formed from theorems stated by the user and how
the knowledge base is used in the theorem-proving process.  an example
of a theorem proved and the english proof output are also given.

a framework for the creation and use of a knowledge base 
of mathematical theorems and definitions

benjamin shults

bshults@math.utexas.edu

this paper covers the framework underlying the ipr prover, some of
whose success is illustrated in atp-127.  the presentation here is
more clear than the presentation in atp-127 but this does not include
the examples of theorems proved.

abstract:

a mathematician knows thousands of theorems and definitions and is
able to choose just the needed results and use them at just the right
time in the theorem-proving process.  the problem of codifying some
bit of this process is the topic of this paper.

ipr is an automatic theorem-proving system intended particularly for
use in mathematics.  it discovers the proofs of theorems in
mathematics by applying known theorems and definitions from a
knowledge base.  theorems and definitions are stored in the knowledge
base in the form of ``sequents'' rather than formulas or rewrite
rules.  the sequents---into which a theorem is reduced before being
put into the knowledge base---consistently mirror the ways a human
might use the theorem.  because the data are in this form, natural
fetching algorithms can be used to search the knowledge base for the
most useful theorem to be used in the theorem-proving process.

       challenge problems in elementary calculus

the following is a list of challenge problems for automated provers.
they are based on the theorem in calculus that the sum of two 
continuous functions is continuous (called lim+).

research interests - micheal hewett
i'm doing research in artificial intelligence, a discipline where
we try to make computers as smart as people are, but not as stupid as they are.

i do research in two areas, ai architectures and 
knowledge-based software engineering.

ai architectures
blackboard systems
i have worked on blackboard systems since 1984 and was formerly lead
programmer on the bb1 project at stanford.  in the last few years i
have studied how to make activation in blackboard systems more efficient.

the 
bb1 software is available from stanford.  i maintain a local copy of bb1.
ask me for more info or see my list of papers.  software will be
available through this page shortly.

access-limited logic
i am currently working on a revision of the 
algernon
representation and reasoning system.
for my thesis i am developing an abstract machine for 
access-limited logic reasoning.
here are test versions of the 
algernon reference manual.

knowledge-based software engineering
i have designed a framework called metamorphos for
controlling a program synthesis system.  it is a knowledge-based
control system written in bb1.  i am using the framework to control 
synthesis in the kids/refine
synthesis environment.  see my list of papers for more info.

here is a 
bibliography of recent kbse articles
you can ftp (87k bytes).  note, this prints out in landscape mode, two
pages per printed page.  it may not view correctly in ghostview, but will
print correctly (at least on mac-compatible printers).

ai programming
here is a summary of allegro cl commands.
if your browser doesn't support tables, here is the same
information in a simpler format.

graphics
i'm not doing research in graphics, but this is a good place to put
a pointer to a page describing the graphics project
i am working on this semester.

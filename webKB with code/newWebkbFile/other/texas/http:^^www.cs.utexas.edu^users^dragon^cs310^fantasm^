 what's new 




bug fixed version: f96.io.v1.1 was installed: log out from your 
current session and relogin and let the machine 'rebuild'. 
after the rebuild, the new version will be visible in the 
[system disk]->[fantasm] folder. use the new version by all means.

bug in f96.io.v1.0 : if you are getting fatal errors when building,
read this:  alignment problems . you do 
not need to do this if you are using v1.1 (see above)

 example programs

	here are some example programs that run under fantasm.
	you have to obtain the [f96.io.v1.0] library files
	from the [system disk]->[fantasm] folder in the new powermacs in the
	macintosh lab in pai.
	
	this is the specification for the following programs:
	 program spec.
	 
		 stroutln : subroutine for printing out 
			pascal style string (length+string)
			
			global definition file 
			    
			   (p4_globals.s)
			source file 
			   
			   (start.s)	
			
		 stroutln : shorter version
			
			global definition file  
			    
			   (p4_globals.s)
			 source file
			   
			   (start.s)

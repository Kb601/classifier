 wonderful events 


i had been baptised on nov. 19, 1995 and joined hyde park baptist church.

i spent a good time on my birthday party. we had a nice dinner at my home and went to karaok at hunan palace. this reminded me of my life in my hometown - guangzhou.
a bunch of my friends took part in the party:
 -my workmates from mathematics department: hongqiu, yue
 -my classmates from computer sciences department: tong wang, zhengxiong
 -my churchmates from hyde park chinese mission: tong zhang, catherine
 -my roommate from nursing school: hsueh-fen
 -my schoolmate from zhongshan university: xinyue
they gave me happiness and warmth. thanx to them!


i went to san diego (a beautiful city at pacific shore) on my winter holidays.

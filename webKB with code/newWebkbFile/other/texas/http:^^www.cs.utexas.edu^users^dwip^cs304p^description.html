syllabus for cs 304p







syllabus for computer science i (cs 304p) 


university of texas at austin 
fall 1996

 


 objectives 
although computers are used widely, most users don't understand how they work, what they
can do, and what they cannot do. this course will teach the fundamental principles of computing
by surveying many of the major areas of computer science, including algorithms, languages
, computer architecture, parallel computation and artificial intelligence. projects
involving pascal programming will accompany the survey.

 objectives 
required textbook:  great ideas in computer science,  by alan biermann, mit press, 1995. 
optional textbook, strongly recommended:   fundamentals of computer science: a study guide,  by j. wesley ulm, 1995. this  guide  was written to supplement
great ideas in computer science. for each chapter of  great ideas ... , the 
 guide  presents a set of problems, and their complete solutions. the  guide  costs about $13.00 and is available at: 
speedway copy and printing 
2021 guadalupe, suite 136, in dobie mall 
478-3334 

 grading 
final grades will be assigned on a curve, based on the following components:

 midterm i: 20%
 midterm ii: 20%
 final: 30%
 lab exercises: 30%


 exams 
the first midterm exam will cover only the material covered in the first six weeks of the semester. the second 
midterm exam is cumulative, but it will emphasize the material covered during weeks
7-11. the final exam is cumulative,  but it will emphasize the material covered during
weeks 12-15. to study for the exams, you should review the assigned readings and your notes
from the lectures and discussion sessions. 
without valid proof of an unexpected emergency, you will receive a grade of zero if you 
miss an exam. 

 lab exercises 
lab exercises will be assigned almost every week in discussion sessions. you should
start to work on the exercises while in the discussion sessions, and complete them 
outside of class. the due date will be clearly stated for each exercise. without valid
proof of an unexpected emergency, you will receive a grade of zero if you miss the deadline. 
you may turn in exercises to your ta or to any cs304p proctor in the computer lab. if
you turn-in an exercise outside of your normal discussion session, you are advised to
ask for a receipt.

 cheating 
turning in an exam which is not entirely your own work is cheating. turning in a 
programming assignment which is not entirely your own work is cheating. cheating results in an 
immediate f course grade and a formal petition for expulsion from the university. no
exceptions. group discussions about course content is not cheating, and is strongly
encouraged.

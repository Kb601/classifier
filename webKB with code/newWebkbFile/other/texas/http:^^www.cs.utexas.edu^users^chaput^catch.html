mst3k catch phrase catalog



the mst3k catch phrase catalog
created by a cast of usenet thousands
updated july 27th, 1995
compiled by cliff chaput







here is the latest version of the mst3k catch phrase catalog.  i have added the
catch phrases suggested to me via email or news.  if you know of any catch
phrases that are not on this list, please let me know.

a "catch phrase" is a phrase that is repeated in more than one episode of mst3k
with no significant content alterations.  by these rules, running gags internal
to a single show (e.g., "james arness... i mean peter graves!" from _it
conquered the world_) and volatile context- based phrase changes (e.g., "jim
henson's ghandi babies", "this week on 'tormented'", etc.) are disqualified.  a
good rule of thumb: if you can use the phase in several conversations without
changing it at all, it's probably a good catch phrase.  (test this rule at your
own risk!)

also, quotes here are listed as they "appear" in mst3k, and not necessarily in
their original form.  the reason is that i intend this to be a catch phrase
catalog, not a catch phrase sources catalog.

 the list is alphabetized for use with the mst3k drinking game.

enjoy.

standard template library manual and source 
 
last updated 09/21/96


the standard template library (stl) was developed at hp labs, and has
been adopted by the ansi c++ standards committe for inclusion in the
standard c++ library.  some compilers are unable to compile the source
code for this library as provided here. if you are using gnu c++, then
it comes with a compatible version of stl in libstdc++., so you should
use that version of stl.  microsoft visual c++ also ships with stl
bundled. borland c++ 4.5 or greater should have no problems compiling
the stl source code here.

if you are on unix, get the self-extracting shell archive (.shar) files. if
you are on a pc, get the .zip files.

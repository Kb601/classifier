the use of partial quantitative information with qualitative reasoning

the use of partial quantitative information with qualitative reasoning
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences, 
the university of texas at austin. 

abstract

there is a need for combining qualitative and quantitative
simulations, to do simulation tasks that would be difficult using
either alone.  this task is made more difficult by the fact that
available quantitative information may be incomplete, bounding values
with intervals or describing them with probability distribution
functions.  this research demonstrates the combination of qualitative
and quantitative simulation in an implemented system, q3.  q3 utilizes
partial or complete quantitative information, to gradually refine a
qualitative simulation into a simulation that has properties and
advantages of both qualitative simulations and quantitative ones.


the technique exemplified by q3 is shown to possess properties often
used in analyzing both qualitative and quantitative simulators.
qualitative and quantitative inferences are correct.  theoretical
convergence to the true solution and stability in the presence of
partial model inputs are also shown.  

q3 has been applied to the problem of finding probabilities of
qualitative behaviors, an important problem.  partial quantitative
characterization of model inputs, in the form of intervals and
probability distributions, may be used to bound the probabilities of
different behaviors.  this is demonstrated for simple models including
one in the dependability analysis application domain.  





spatial learning mobile robots with a spatial semantic hierarchical model

spatial learning mobile robots with a spatial semantic hierarchical model
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin.  

abstract

the goal of this dissertation is to develop a spatial exploration and
map-learning strategy for a mobile robot to use in unknown,
large-scale environments.  traditional approaches aim at building
purely metrically accurate maps.  because of sensorimotor errors, it
is hard to construct accurately such maps.  however, in spite of
sensory and computation limitation, humans explore environments, build
cognitive maps from exploration, and successfully path-plan, navigate,
and place-find.  based on the study of human cognitive maps, we
develop a spatial semantic hierarchical model to replace the global
absolute coordinate frame used in traditional approaches.  the
semantic hierarchical model consists of three levels: control level,
topological level, and geometrical level.  the topological level
provides the basic structure of the hierarchy.  

at the control level, a robot finds places or follows travel edges
which can be described by qualitatively definable features.  the
distinctive features allow development of distinctiveness measures.
the robot uses these measures to find, with negative feedback control,
the distinctive places by hill-climbing search algorithms, and the
travel edges by edge-following algorithms.  distinctive places and
travel edges are connected to build a topological model.  this model
is created prior to the construction of a global geometrical map.
cumulative location error is essentially eliminated while traveling
among distinctive places and travel edges by alternating between the
hill-climbing search control algorithms and the edge-following control
algorithms.  on top of the topological model, metrical information is
accumulated first locally and then globally.  

using a simulation package with a robot instance, nx, we demonstrate
the robustness of our method against sensorimotor errors.  the control
knowledge for distinctive places and travel edges, the topological
matching process, and the metrical matching process with local
geometry make our approach robust in the face of metrical errors.  in
addition to robust navigation at the control and topological levels,
our framework can incorporate certain metrically-based methods and
thus provide the best of both approaches.  



access-limited logic -- a language for knowledge representation

access-limited logic -- a language for knowledge representation
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin.  

abstract

 access-limited logic (all) is a language for knowledge representation
which formalizes the access limitations inherent in a network
structured knowledge-base.  where a deductive method such as
resolution would retrieve all assertions that satisfy a given pattern,
an access-limited logic retrieves all assertions reachable by
following an available access path.  the time complexity of inference
is thus a polynomial function of the size of the accessible portion of
the knowledge-base, rather than the size of the entire knowledge-base.
access-limited logic, though incomplete, still has a well defined
semantics and a weakened form of completeness, socratic completeness,
which guarantees that for any query which is a logical consequence of
the knowledge-base, there exists a series of queries after which the
original query will succeed.  we have implemented all in lisp and it
has been used to build several non-trivial systems, including versions
of qualitative process theory and pearl's probability networks.  all
is a step toward providing the properties - clean semantics, efficient
inference, expressive power - which will be necessary to build large,
effective knowledge bases.  




monitoring and diagnosis of continuous dynamic systems using semiquantitative simulation

daniel louis dvorak.  1992.

monitoring and diagnosis of continuous dynamic systems using semiquantitative simulation
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin.  

abstract

 operative diagnosis or diagnosis of a physical system in operation,
is essential for systems that cannot be stopped every time an anomaly
is detected, such as in the process industries, space missions, and
medicine.  compared to maintenance diagnosis where the system is
offline and arbitrary points can be probed, operative diagnosis is
limited mainly to sensor readings, and diagnosis begins while the
effects of a fault are still propagating.  symptoms change as the
system's dynamic behavior unfolds.  

this paper presents a design for monitoring and diagnosis of
deterministic continuous dynamic systems based on the paradigms of
"monitoring as model corroboration" and "diagnosis as model
modification" in which a semiquantitative model of aphysical system is
simulated in synchrony with incoming sensor readings.  when sensor
readings disagree with predictions, variant models are created
representing different fault hypotheses.  these models are then
simulated and either corroborated or refuted as new readings arrive.
the set of models changes as new hypotheses are generated and as old
hypotheses are exonerated.  in contrast to methods that base diagnosis
on a snapshot of behavior, this simulation-based approach exploits the
system's time-varying behavior for diagnostic clues and exploits the
predictive power of the model to forewarn of imminent hazards.  

the design holds several other advantages over existing methods: 1)
semiquantitative models provide greater expressive power for states of
incomplete knowledge than differential equations, thus eliminating
certain modeling compromises; 2) semiquantitative simulation generates
guaranteed bounds on variables, thus providing dynamic alarm
thresholds and thus fewer fault detection errors than with
fixed-threshold alarms; 3) the guaranteed prediction of all valid
behaviors eliminates the "missing prediction bug" in diagnosis; 4) the
branching-time descruption of behavior permits recognition of all
valid manifestations of a fault (and of interacting faults); 5)
hypotheses based on predictive semiquantitative models are more
informative because they show the values of unseen variables and can
predict future consequences; and 6) fault detection degrades
gracefully as multiple faults are diagnosed over time.  



automated modeling of physical systems in the presence of incomplete knowledge

automated modeling of physical systems in the presence of incomplete knowledge
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin. 

abstract


this dissertation presents an approach to automated reasoning about
physical systems in the presence of {\em incomplete knowledge} which
supports formal analysis, proof of guarantees, has been fully
implemented, and applied to substantial domain modeling problems.
predicting and reasoning about the behavior of physical systems is a
difficult and important task that is essential to everyday commonsense
reasoning and to complex engineering tasks such as design, monitoring,
control, or diagnosis.  

a capability for automated modeling and simulation requires
 
   expressiveness to represent incomplete knowledge,
   algorithms to draw useful inferences about non-trivial systems,
and 
   precise semantics to support meaningful guarantees of
correctness. 
 

in order to clarify the structure of the knowledge required for
reasoning about the behavior of physical systems, we distinguish
between the model building task which builds a model to describe
the system, and the simulation task which uses the model to
generate a description of the possible behaviors of the system.  

this dissertation describes qpc, an implemented approach to reasoning
about physical systems that builds on the expressiveness of
qualitative process theory [forbus, 1984] and the mathematical
rigor of the qsim qualitative simulation algorithm [kuipers, 1986].  

the semantics of qpc's modeling language are grounded in the
mathematics of ordinary differential equations and their solutions.
this formalization enables the statement and proof of qpc's
correctness.  if the domain theory is adequate and the initial
description of the system is correct, then the actual behavior of the
system must be in the set of possible behaviors qpc predicts.  

qpc has been successfully applied to problems in botany and complex
examples drawn from chemical engineering, as well as numerous smaller
problems.  experience has shown that the modeling language is
expressive enough to describe complex domains and that the inference
mechanism is powerful enough to predict the behavior of substantial
systems.  




a theory of teleology


david wayne franke.  1993.

a theory of teleology
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin. 

abstract

 a representation language for teleological descriptions, or
descriptions of purpose, is defined.  the teleological language, ted,
expresses the descriptions of purpose in terms of design modifications
that guarantee the satisfaction of design specifications.  these
specifications express potential behaviors the designed artifact
should or should not exhibit.  we define an abstraction relation on
behavior and implement model checking and classification algorithms
that computethis abstraction relation. the model checking algorithm
determines whether or not a behavior satisfies a specification.  the
classification algorithm provides effective indexing of behaviors and
teleological descriptions.  we implement an acquistion technique for
teleological descriptions and demonstrate how teleological
descriptions can subsequently be used in diagnosis, explanation,
case-based reasoning, design by analogy, and design reuse.  

we demonstrate the behavior language, teleology language, acquisition
of teleological descriptions, and application of teleological
descriptions in explanation, diagnosis, and design reuse via examples
in the thermal, hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical domains.  we
define additional teleological operators that express purposes like
prevent, order, synchronize, maintain, and regulate, demonstrating the
ability to represent common human-generated descriptions of purpose in
ted.  expressing the purpose of preventing an undesirable behavior is
unique to ted, and is an example of ted's ability to express purposes
regarding missing behaviors and components removed from a design.  

the teleology language developed in this work represents a significant
advance over previous work by providing a formal language that 1) is
independent of any particular domain of mechanisms or behavior
language, 2) can be effectively acquired during the design process,
and 3) provides an effective means of classifying and indexing
teleological descriptions.  




high-speed navigation with approximate maps


richard allan froom.  1995.  

high-speed navigation with approximate maps.
ph.d. dissertation, the university of texas at austin.   


abstract

a global map of a mobile robot's environment is essential for high-performance
navigation in large-scale space.  when portions of the environment are not
visible, a map is needed for route planning and enables high performance by
allowing the robot to anticipate regions that are occluded or beyond sensor
range.  yet, autonomously acquired global map information is inevitably
uncertain due to the low positioning accuracy of mobile robots and the
possibility of changes to the environment. 

previous work in high-speed navigation falls into two categories.  global
optimization approaches assume that an accurate model of environment geometry
and robot dynamics are available, and address the problem of efficiently
approximating the minimum-time control between a start and goal state.  reactive
navigation methods use only immediately sensed environment geometry to avoid
obstacles while moving to a specified goal position.  the global optimization
approach has the theoretical advantage of high performance, but it does not
address the significant uncertainty typical of mobile robots.  the reactive
navigation approach can respond to unanticipated geometry, but its overall
performance is limited. 

this dissertation describes a method for high-speed map-guided navigation in
realistic conditions of uncertainty.  a previously-developed method is used to
acquire a topologically correct, metrically approximate map of the environment
despite positioning errors.  information in the approximate map guides the
operation of a novel, high-performance reactive navigator.  performance does not
critically depend on the availability of expensive, accurate metrical
information.  nonetheless, the map may be elaborated with more detailed
information, and, as its level of detail and accuracy is improved, performance
smoothly improves. 




automatic control understanding for natural programs


john hartman.  1991.

automatic control understanding for natural programs
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin.  

abstract

 program understanding involves recognizing abstract concepts like
"read-process loop" in existing programs.  programmers spend much of
their time understanding programs, so studying and automating the
process has many benefits.  

programming plans are units of programming knowledge connecting
abstract concepts and their implementations.  existing research
assumes that plan instances can be recognized to recover the
programmer's abstract concepts and intentions, but this approach has
not been confirmed empirically.  

we present a practical method for bottom-up control concept
recognition in large, unstructured imperative programs.  control
concepts are abstract notions about interactions between control flow,
data flow and computation, such as "do loop", "read process loop", and
"bounded linear search".  they are recognized by comparing an abstract
program representation against a library of standard implementation
plans.  the program representation is a hierarchical control flow/data
flow graph decomposed into a tree of sub-models using propers (single
entry/exit control flow sub-graphs).  plans are represented by similar
graphs with added qualifications.  recognition is based on simple
matching between sub-models and plans.  the method was implemented in
the unprog program understander and tested with cobol and lisp source
programs.  

this method is robust, efficient, and scalable.  the program
representation can be formed for all language constructs which permit
static determination of control and data flow.  comparing sub-models
and comparisons increases linearly with program size.  

unprog has been applied to automatic cobol restructuring.  knowledge
associated with plans and concepts permits more specific and
insightful transformation, code generation, and documentation than is
possible with syntactic methods.  control understanding can similarly
raise the level of other reverse engineering and re-engineering tools
for applications like analysis, documentation, and translation.  

we also showed how our method and unprog can be used for empirical
study of programs at the conceptual level.  results can be used to
improve recognizer performance, acquire plans, catalog natural plans
and concepts, test the hypothesis that programs are planful, and
characterize program populations.  



geometrical motion planning for highly redundant manipulators using a continuous model


akira hayashi.  1991.

geometrical motion planning for highly redundant manipulators using a continuous model
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin.  

abstract

 there is a need for highly redundant manipulators to work in complex,
cluttered environments.  our goal is to plan paths for such
manipulators efficiently.  

the path planning problem has been shown to be pspace-complete in
terms of the number of degrees of freedom (dof) of the manipulator.
we present a method which overcomes the complexity with a strong
heuristic: utilizing redundancy by means of a continuous manipulator
model.  the continuous model allows us to change the complexity of the
problem from a function of both the dof of the manipulator (believed
to be exponential) and the complexity of the environment (polynomial),
to a polynomial function of the complexity of the environment only.  

the power of the continuous model comes from the ability to decompose
the manipulator into segments, with the number, size, and boundaries
of the segments, varying smoothly and dynamically.  first, we develop
motion schemas for the individual segments to achieve a basic set of
goals in open and cluttered space.  second, we plan a smooth
trajectory through free space for a point robot with a maximum
curvature constraint.  third, the path generates a set of position
subgoals for the continuous manipulator which are achieved by the
basic motion schemas.  fourth, the mapping from the continuous model
to an available jointed arm provides the curvature bound and obstacle
envelopes required (in step 2) to guarantee a collision-free path.  

the validity of the continuous model approach is also supported by an
extensive simulation which we performed.  while the simulation has
been performed in 2-d, we show a natural extension to 3-d for each
technique we have implemented for the 2-d simulation.  



refining imprecise models and their behaviors


herbert kay.  1996.  

refining imprecise models and their behaviors.
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences, the university of texas
at austin, december 1996.

abstract

this dissertation describes methods for simulating and refining
imprecisely-defined ordinary differential equation (ode) systems.
when constructing a model of a physical process, a modeler must cope
with uncertainty due to incomplete knowledge of the process.  for
tasks such as design and diagnosis, the effects of this uncertainty
must be considered.  however, predicting the behavior of an
imprecisely-defined model is not easy since the model covers a space
of many precise instances, each of which behaves differently.  

while model uncertainty cannot be completely eliminated, it is
possible to reduce it.  model refinement uses observations
of a physical process to rule out portions of the model space that
could not have produced the observations.  as more experience with the
physical process is gained, the imprecision in the model is further
reduced.  

this dissertation describes three methods for reasoning with imprecise
ode models.  sqsim is a simulator
that produces a guaranteed bound on the behavior of an imprecise ode
model.  by using a multiple-level representation and inference methods
that span the qualitative-to-quantitative spectrum, sqsim produces
predictions whose uncertainty is consistent with model
imprecision.  we demonstrate sqsim on a complex, nonlinear chemical
process and compare it to other methods for simulating imprecise
ode models.  

msquid is a function estimator for fitting (and bounding) noisy data
that is known to be monotonic.  it uses a neural-network inspired
model and nonlinear constrained optimization to search a
space of monotonic functions.  we prove that msquid can estimate any
monotonic function and show that it produces better estimates than
does unconstrained optimization.  

squid, which uses sqsim and msquid as components, is a system
identification method that refines an imprecise model using a stream
of observations from a physical process.  squid uses refutation to
rule out portions of the model space that are inconsistent with the
observations.  we show that this approach to refinement is
significantly more efficient than parameter estimation for models with
functional uncertainty and that it provides greater robustness in the
face of uninformative observations.  



spatial semantic hierarchy for a physical mobile robot


wan yik lee.  1996.  

spatial semantic hierarchy for a physical mobile robot.
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences, the university of texas
at austin, december 1996.

abstract

this dissertation describes research to extend and improve the
spatial semantic hierarchy (ssh) approach to robot exploration
and mapping, and to demonstrate and evaluate its effectiveness in
controlling physical mobile robots.  

the ssh approach for robot exploration and mapping was first developed
in the context of a simulated robot, nx, and tested in simulated
environments with very simple models of sensorimotor error.  physical
implementations of aspects of the ssh approach have been built by
other researchers but they do not provide adequate demonstration of
its strengths or adequate analysis of its conditions of applicability.


the dissertation work extended and improved the ssh mapping theory
from its original prototype to a version capable of handling
real sensorimotor interaction with a real (office)
environment. the underlying goal of this research is to demonstrate
how symbolic representations and symbol-based behaviors of an
autonomous robot can be grounded in non-symbolic, continuous
sensorimotor interaction with a real environment through the ssh
approach.  the extended theory is implemented on a physical robot to
explore a previously unknown environment, and to create an ssh spatial
description of the environment. this dissertation describes the
improved ssh mapping theory, the details of its implementation on a
physical robot, and a demonstration and evaluation of several features
of the implemention. 




a qualitative simulation based method to construct phase portraits


wood wai lee.  1993.
a qualitative simulation based method to construct phase portraits
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin.  

abstract

 we have designed a qualitative simulation based method to construct
phase portraits for a significant class of systems of two first order
autonomous differential equations.  it is intended as a step toward
automated understanding of continuous physical systems.  differential
equation models are powerful tools for reasoning about physical
systems, but they typically require precise information about systems.
recently developed methods for qualitative simulation make it possible
to predict all possible behaviors consistent with a state of
incomplete, qualitative knowledge of the world, expressed as a
qualitative differential equation (qde).  however, qualitative
simulation can fail due to intractable branching, and spurious
predictions.  the field of nonlinear dynamics has introduced the phase
portrait representation as a powerful tool for the global analysis of
nonlinear differential equations.  a state of the system is
represented by a point in phase space; its behavior over time is
represented by a trajectory.  when the phase portrait is
two-dimensional, the solutions to a differential equation can be
characterized by the system's fixed points, bundles of adjacent
trajectories (called flows), and certain bounding trajectories.
numeric methods for constructing phase portraits require numerically
specific information about the system.  we demonstrate a method and an
implemented program, qportrait, that constructs two-dimensional phase
portraits from qde's.  starting with the total envisionment (a finite
transition-graph representation of the possible behaviors of a
system), qportrait progressively identifies, classifies, and combines
features of the phase portrait, abstracting away uninteresting
distinctions, and filtering out inconsistent combinations of features.
because each step in the analysis is validity-preserving, the
prediction is guaranteed to cover all real phase portraits consistent
with qde.  in its current form qportrait phase applies to a restricted
but nontrivial set of qde models.  it requires that all fixed-points
be non degenerate, and be at landmark values for the phase variables.
qportrait has produced tractable results when applied to qualitative
generalizations of several well-known nonlinear systems.  guaranteed
coverage of the behavior of a qualitatively described set of qde's
complements the precision of numeric methods based approaches.  




map learning with uninterpreted sensors and effectors



 david m. pierce.  1995.  

map learning with uninterpreted sensors and effectors.
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences, the university of texas
at austin.

abstract


this dissertation presents a set of methods by which a learning agent,
called a ``critter,'' can learn a sequence of increasingly abstract and
powerful interfaces to control a robot whose sensorimotor apparatus and
environment are initially unknown.  the result of the learning is a rich,
hierarchical model of the robot's world (its sensorimotor apparatus and
environment).  the learning methods rely on generic properties of the
robot's world such as almost-everywhere smooth effects of actions on
sensory features. 

at the lowest level of the hierarchy, the critter analyzes the effects of
its actions in order to define control signals, one for each of the robot's
degrees of freedom.  it uses a generate-and-test approach to define sensory
features that capture important aspects of the environment.  it uses linear
regression to learn action models that characterize context-dependent
effects of the control signals on the learned features.  it uses these
models to define high-level control laws for finding and following paths
defined using constraints on the learned features.  the critter abstracts
these control laws, which interact with the continuous environment, to a
finite set of actions that implement discrete state transitions.  at this
point, the critter has abstracted the robot's world to a finite-state
machine and can use existing methods to learn its structure. 




qualitative reasoning about dynamic change in the
spatial properties of a physical system



raman rajagopalan.  1995.  

qualitative reasoning about
dynamic change in the spatial properties of a physical system.
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences, the university
of texas at austin.  

abstract

spatial reasoning is an essential part of human interaction with the physical 
world.  of the many models that have been developed to support automated
spatial reasoning, most rely on numerical descriptions of a spatial scene.
this dissertation addresses problems where only qualitative descriptions 
of a spatial scene are available, such as natural language understanding,
qualitative design, and physics problem-solving. 

we provide the first set of solutions, given only a qualitative description 
of a spatial scene, for reasoning about dynamic change in both the spatial 
and non-spatial properties of a physical system.  we use diagrams to 
compactly input the spatial scene for a problem, and text to describe 
any non-spatial properties.  to match diagram and text objects so their
descriptions can be integrated, we have developed a method for describing 
the conceptual class of objects directly in diagrams.  then, diagram and 
text objects can be matched based on their conceptual class. 

the given problem is solved through qualitative simulation, and
all spatial reasoning is done with respect to an extrinsic cartesian 
coordinate system.  we model the relative positions of objects through 
inequality constraints on the coordinates of the points of interest.  changes 
due to translational motion are detected by noting changes in the truth
values of inequality constraints.  we model the orientation of an object 
through knowledge of its extremal points and its qualitative angle of 
rotation with respect to each coordinate axis.  this model has been used to 
reason qualitatively about the effects of rotational motion, 
such as changes in the area projected by one object onto another. 

we have implemented our spatial representation as production rules
and as model fragments in the qpc qualitative modeling system.  the former
has been used for solving static-world problems such as understanding 
descriptions of an urban scene.  the latter has been used to reason 
about situations where changes in spatial properties play a critical role, 
such as the operation of transformers, oscillators, generators, and motors.
to support dynamic spatial reasoning, we have expanded the modeling 
capabilities of qpc to include methods for modeling piecewise-continuous 
variables, non-permanent objects, and variables with circular quantity spaces. 




model-based diagnosis of complex, continuous mechanisms


david rutherford throop.  1991.

model-based diagnosis of complex, continuous mechanisms
doctoral dissertation, department of computer sciences,
the university of texas at austin.  

abstract

 in diagnosis, when a hypothesis proposes a variable's value, several
different lines of evidence may be considered; the different evidence
must be arbitrated.  the result of this arbitration consists of a
single best estimate of the variable value and of a measure of that
estimate's plausibility.  the plausibility measure reflects the degree
of agreement among the lines of evidence.  

this report describes heatx, a program for model-based diagnosis of
non-linear mechanisms with continuous variables.  previous work in
model-based diagnosis has avoided arbitrating numeric evidence, often
by representing continuous variables as discrete symbols (e.g., high,
cold).  such restricted representation have had difficulty in
diagnosing mechanisms with feedback or reconvergent fanout.  heatx
represents numerical data explicitly in the hypotheses and in the
inferencing procedures; it is thereby able to arbitrate evidence
numerically.  

heatx uses both nonlinear numerical simulations and approximate linear
models to perform diagnosis in the domain of heat-exchanger networks.
the response of these networks to changes in their inputs is
nonlinear; the networks also have feedback and reconvergent fanout.
this dissertation introduces several novel techniques for diagnosing
such networks.  it interleaves the generation of complete fault
hypotheses with several tests on partially formed hypotheses.  two of
these tests are the qualitative filter and the clustering filter.  

the qualitative filter analyzes the signs of gains between fault and
symptom variables.  the clustering filter constructs linear
approximations to individual components and assembles these into a
linear model of the network.  it then uses the linear model to assess
the consistency of a hypothesis.  it does so by determining whether
there is a value for the candidate fault variable which is consistent
with the quantitative values of the symptom variables; the degree of
agreement between the symptoms and best value for the fault variable
is used to score the hypothesis.  this filter is extended to
multi-fault diagnosis, in which values for several fault variable may
be estimated and judged simultaneously.

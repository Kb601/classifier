current implementation status 




platforms:
	    
	    
            hermes is currently supported on two platforms, the 
            unix/x platform, and the pc/windows platform.
	    

distributed implementation:

            
            a client-server based implementation of hermes currently
            accesses data at 9 sites worldwide across the internet.
            addition of a new site to the network may be accomplished
            very quickly (30 minutes).  the following information describes
            the geographic distribution of currently-participating sites.

            additional sites are currently being added.

          the time taken to integrate a new package is approximately 1-2
          weeks of a full-time programmer, but could vary depending upon the
          package being designed.  help tools for this include a 
          domain integration toolkit that may be used to integrate software at
          the systems level.  this toolkit is still being constructed;
          a preliminary version is expected to be available sometime during
          may 1995.

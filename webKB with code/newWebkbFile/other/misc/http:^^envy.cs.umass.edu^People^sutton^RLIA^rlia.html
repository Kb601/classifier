introductory patter

in this talk we will try to take a new look at the
learning problem in information access.  how is it structured?  what
training information is really available, or likely to be available?  
will there be delays between decision making and the receipt of relevant
feedback?  i am a newcomer to information access, but i have experience in reinforcement learning, and one of the main lessons of
reinforcement learning is that it is really important to understand the
true nature of the learning problem you want to solve.

here is an example that illustrates the whole idea.  in 1989 gerry
tesauro at ibm built the world's best computer player of backgammon.  it
was a neural network trained from 15,000 examples of human-expert 
moves.  then he tried a reinforcement learning approach.  he trained the
same network not from expert examples, but simply by playing it against
itself and observing the outcomes.  after a month of self-play, the program 
became the new world champ of computers.  now it is an extremely strong
player, on a par with the world's best grandmasters, who are now
learning from it!  the self-play approach worked so well
primarily because it could generate new training data itself.  the
expert-trained network was always limited by its 15,000 examples,
laboriously constructed by human experts.  self-play training data may
be individually less informative, but so much more of it can be
generated so cheaply that it is a big win in the long run.

the same may be true for information access.  right now we use training
sets of documents labeled by experts as relevant or not relevant.  such
training data will always be expensive, scarce, and small.  how much
better it would be if we could generate some kind of training data
online, from the normal use of the system.  the data may be imperfect 
and unclear, but certainly it will be plentiful!  it may also be truer in
an important sense.  expert-labeled training sets are artificial, and do not
accurately mirror real usage.  in backgammon, the expert-trained system
could only learn to mimic the experts, not to win the game.  only
the online-trained system was able to learn to play better than the
experts. its training data was more real.

this then is the challenge: to think about information access and
uncover the real structure of the learning problem.  how can learning be
done online?  learning thrives on data, data, data!  how can we get the
data we need online, from the normal operation of the system, without
relying on expensive, expert-labeled training sets?

this talk proceeds in three parts. the first is an introduction to
reinforcement learning.  the second examines how parts of the
learning problem in information access are like those solved by
reinforcement learning methods.  but the information access problem doesn't map exactly onto
the reinforcement learning problem.  it has a special structure all it own.  in the third
part of the talk we examine some of this special structure and what kind
of new learning methods might be applied to it.


the rest below are approximations to the slides presented in
the talk. 





conclusions (in advance)


 learning in ia (information access) is like learning everywhere
     
      you are never told the right answers
      its a sequential problem - actions affect opportunities
     
 reinforcement learning addresses these issues
 learning can be powerful when done online (from normal operation)
 what is online data/feedback like in ia?





reinforcement learning


  learning by trial and error, rewards and punishments,

  active, multidisciplinary research area

  an overall approach to ai
    
	based on learning from interaction with the environment
	integrates learning, planning, reacting...
	handles stochastic, uncertain environments
    
  recent large-scale, world-class applications

  not about particular learning mechanisms

  is about learning with less helpful feedback







classical machine learning - supervised learning



	situation1  --->  action1     then correct-action1
	situation2  --->  action2     then correct-action2
		      .
		      .
		      .








  correct action supplied
  objective is % correct
  actual actions have no effect
  each interaction is independent, self contained







reinforcement learning


	        situation1  --->  action1
	reward2	situation2  --->  action2 
	reward3	situation3  --->  action3 
	                     .
	                     .
	                     .











  agent never told which action is correct
  agent told nothing about actions not selected
  actions may affect next situation
  object is to maximize all future rewards












it's not just a harder problem, it's a real problem


 problems with relevance feedback:
	
	 what about all the documents not shown?
	 the exploration-exploitation dilemma
	 degrees of relevance
    

 we don't want to make user happy only in the short term

 many solutions require sequences of steps
	how do you support the early steps?

 sl can't be used reliably on-line (except for immed. prediction)
	 can't learn from normal operation 





applications of rl


 td-gammon and jellyfish -- tesauro, dahl

 elevator control -- crites

 job-shop scheduling -- zhang & dietterich

 mobile robot controllers -- lin, miller, thrun, ...

 computer vision -- peng et al.

 natural language / dialog tuning -- gorin, henis

 characters for interactive games -- handelman & lane

 airline seat allocation -- hutchinson

 manufacturing of composite materials -- sofge & white






key ideas of rl algorithms

value functions

 like a heuristic state evaluation function -- but learned
 approximates the expected future reward after a state or action
 the idea:	learn "how good" an action is,
		rather than whether or not it is the best,
		taking into account long-term affects
 value functions vastly simplify everything


td methods
 
 an efficient way of learning to predict (e.g., value functions)
from experience and search 
 learning a guess from a guess






a large space of rl algorithms







major components of an rl agent









policy - what to do

reward - what is good

value - what is good because it predicts reward

model - what follows what






info-access applications of rl


anytime you have decisions to be made
	 and desired choice is not immediately clear 

anytime you want to make long-term predictions




classical ir querying/routing/filtering as rl


	situation = query or user model + documents
	actions	  = present document?  rankings
	reward	  = user feedback on presented docs

pro rl:
	feedback is selective
	and does not exactly fit sl framework

con rl:
	feedback does not exactly fit rl framework
	problem is not sequential

e.g.,
bartell, cottrell & belew, 1995
boyan, freitag & joachim 1996
schŸtze, hull & pederson, 1995






multistep info-access problems


 query/search optimization
 entertainment
 software ir agents
 information assistant
 routing/filtering
 interface manager
 web browsing
 anticipating user

but in a sense all these are the same

learning a complex, interactive, goal-directed, input-sensitive, sequence of steps


that's exactly what rl is good for.





the multi-step, sequential nature of ia


 the web page that led to the web page
 the request of user that enabled a much better query
 the query whose results enabled user to refine his next query
 the ordering of search steps
 the document that turned out not to be useful
 the series of searches, each building on the prior's results






imagine an ideal info-access system


 continuous oportunity to provide query info:
	  keywords, type specs, feedback 
 continuously updated list of proposed documents
	  find the good ones as soon as possible! 
 actions: all the things that could be done to pursue the search
	 
	 when, where to send queries (alta vista? yahoo? ...)
	 when, what to ask user (synonyms, types, utilities...)
	 what documents to propose
	 which links to follow
	 who else to consult
	 
 situations: the whole current status of the search
 reward: good and bad buttons, maintaining interest, etc
 value: how good is this action? what rewards will it lead to?





shortcutting

 
 feedback is often more than good/bad

 often it does indicate the desired response
	 
	 not for the one situation,
	 but for the whole sequence of prior situations
	

 each good document is
	 
	 a positive example    -  this is what i was looking for
	 a negative example  -  why wasn't this found earlier?
	

 the result of each search can be generalized, learned, anticipated, shortcutted

 this "anticipation" process is similar to certain rl processes...





compare...


the classical context
 
	 large numbers of documents (e.g., 2 million)
	 a few queries (e.g., 200)
	
no way the queries can be used to learn about the docs

the web

	 large numbers of documents
	 even more queries
	
there will always be more readings than writings
thus, we can learn about the docs
    
     how good are they?
     who are they good for?
     what keywords are appropriate for them?
    




popularity ratings, priors on documents 


q. how do you decide what to access today?
		  scientific papers, books, movies, web pages...

a. recommendations:	
	
	 reviewed journals
	 movie critics
	 cool site of the day
	 # visitors to site
	 what your colleagues are talking about
	

"its hard to find the good stuff on the web"

but in classical ir there is no concept of good stuff
	 docs are relevant or not, but not good or bad





differences and similarities between users


 now users provide feedback as a favor, to help others, 
	or because they are paid or the program forces them to
 they ought to be providing feedback for selfish reasons
 suppose you had a personal research assistant... 
	wouldn't you tell him what you liked and didn't like?
 user differences ==> selfish feedback ==> known user similarities






summary


 data is power!  what relevant data is/will be available? 
 relevance vs utility
 independent vs multi-step queries
 shortcutting
 collaborative filtering
 selfish feedback
 learning classifications that help

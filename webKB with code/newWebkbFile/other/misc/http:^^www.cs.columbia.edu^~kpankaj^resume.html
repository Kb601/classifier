current status
  i am working as a graduate research assistant (phd) in the
department of computer science, columbia university, new york city.  i am a
member of the database research group and am currently working on some view
maintenance problems using sybase as a platform for my experiments.





education
  b.s in computer science from indian instiute of technology,
madras, india in 1995. 





skills
 



 operating systems: sunos 4.x, solaris 2.x, bsd, dos.




 languages: c, pascal, lisp, c++, 80x86 assembly
 



 databases: worked on oracle and sybase.
 





past projects
 



 a database for library management using oracle rdbms. included in it
 were provisions for maintaining details of faculty, students and employees.
 retrieval and updation was made possible through a friendly user interface
 implemented using sql-forms.





 implementation of some of the routing algorithms for the network layer. this
 was done as part of a project to develop a layered protocol suite confirming
 to the osi model.
 



 a compiler for a subset of the pascal programming language using the compiler
 building tools lex and yacc.




a mathematical package for scientific use. this included matrix operations,
curve fitting, interpolation, integration, calculator, graph plotter, solving
equations using newton-raphson method, solving simultaneous linear equations,
fft among others. among the facilities provided were a friendly user interface
and editing, loading and saving files.




 design of an 8031-based card that receives data from an rs232c serial port
 and transfers data to a parallel printer port (centronics interface).




i have done the following in dos environment



        - a memory testing worm that checks a segment by replicating itself.



        - a utility which provides file transfer, talk between two pc's
	connected by serial port with a friendly interface to set the baudrate
          and other parameters.
	  


       -  a restricted dos-like operating system using bios calls. it comes
          up before dos and provides a monitor for viewing/modifying
	  registers/memory locations in addition to handling the disk
	  operations, loading and executing an executable file in a controlled
	  way.



        - a tsr alarm program

description

  linux is an extremely popular os for i386 machines, with ports for m68k macintosh
and amiga machines, mips based machines, and dec alphas.



  one of the reasons that linux is so popular is that its development
is completely open -- anyone can contribute.


availability

  there are several linux distributions out there, both available on
cdrom and by ftp.  linux is free, but their is a price for the
distributions.  this is to pay for the cdrom burning, as well as
tech support.

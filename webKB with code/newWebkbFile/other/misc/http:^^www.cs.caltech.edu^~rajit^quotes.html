at first i hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse
but i soon realized it was doomed to success.  almost anything in
software can be implemented, sold, and even used given enough
determination.  there is nothing a mere scientist can say that will
stand against the flood of a hundred million dollars.  but there is
one quality that cannot be purchased in this way---and that is
reliability.  the price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost
simplicity.  it is a price which the very rich find most hard to pay. 
 -- c.a.r. hoare in the emperor's old clothes,
        turing award lecture (27 october 1980)

deficiencies.
 -- c. a. r. hoare 


 in science, "fact" can only mean "confirmed to such a 
degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional

but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics 
classrooms.
  -- stephen jay gould

 -- antoine de saint-exupery



where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
 where knowledge is free;
 where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
 where words come from the depths of truth;
 where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
 where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary 
                        desert sands of dead habit;
 where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action;
 into that heaven of freedom, my father, let my country awake.
  -- rabindranath tagore

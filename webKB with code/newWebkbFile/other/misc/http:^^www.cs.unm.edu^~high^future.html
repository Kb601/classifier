engines for emergent intelligence



attempts to create machines exhibiting intelligent behavior can be roughly
sorted along a continuum between symbolic artificial intelligence (sai) and
connectionist artificial intelligence (cai).  
symbolic ai is a
top-down approach to the engineering of intelligent behavior.  
the physical-symbol hypothesis of newell and simon
(1972) suggests (correctly, i believe) that human
thought can be fully described in terms of the manipulation of abstract
symbols, embodied as states in the physical world.  the common 
(mis)interpretation
(incorrect, i believe) is that symbols are discrete entities like those
found in computer programming languages (e.g. object = bird, color = blue).
this is a bias due to both the computer scientist's special 
perceptual system but also the basic human perceptual system.
that mind has a physical basis is apparent.
that this physical basis can be construed as a processing of physical
symbols seems acceptable, but only if we allow a loose
definition of the word "symbol."

approach to solving the problem that has someinteresting properties in its ability to support large numbers of users atfixed transmission rates at a relatively low cost. introduction   a major goal of all computer network designs is the distribution ofinformation in a fast, error free manor at the lowest possible cost. one methodof accomplishing this goal is to use already existing technologies in new andimaginative ways. although designed for different purposes, the cabletelevision systems (catv) already in place in much of the u.s. provide aninteresting and potentially useful platform for the distribution of digitaldata on a metropolitan area scale. as the catv systems in use were initiallydesigned for one way communications, any plan to use them must include eitherupgrading currently installed upstream amplifiers or the actual implementationof them.the problems associated with using these types of facilities were studied andit has been demonstrated that using such facilities is technically andeconomically feasible [karshmer, thomas and phelan - 1991; karshmer and thomas- 1989]. these studies along with others [hatamain - 1985; hafez - 1985] havedemonstrated potential strengths and weaknesses in using such systems. possiblythe greatest strength of using catv based networks is their almost universalexistence in the u.s. approximately 60% of all homes are currently connected toa cable plant, and virtually every building in most cities is "passed" by acable.        one of the key problems associated with using the branching treetopology of a cable plant is access control. due to the separation of upstreamand downstream channels, any message from a source node (a leaf) must be sentupstream to the head end and then downstream to the destination node (anotherleaf). this round-trip time can cause a large delay message transmission andreception which can render an access control technique such as csma/cd useless.in the current work, we present results from the analysis of a system thatreduces message transmission time on a two-way catv network while notdecreasing network throughput. we develop a model of a two-level catvnetworking scheme which is then tested using well know simulation techniques.finally, the simulation results are analyzed and are compared to bestthroughput and expected delay times.distributed switching over a single-trunk catv networkfigure 1 shows a simplified view of our two-level, single-trunk catvnetwork with m switches installed on the trunk. each switch is in turnconnected to a branch cable that supports k branch nodes (networksubscribers). each trunk node (switch) has three inputs (trunk upstream,trunk downstream and branch upstream) as well as three outputs. eachbranch node has one output for branch upstream and one input for branchdownstreamsince all trunk nodes have a certain level of intelligence, thetraffic flow on the trunk is totally controlled. the goal of the intelligenttrunk nodes is to turn-around messages onto the appropriate branch cable at theearliest possible time. the head end is therefore not the only node to that canredirect messages. if our system is able to redirect messages at the earliestpossible time, we believe the system can reduce message travel time, reducemessage delay and increase system throughput.figure 2 shows the simulation results for the 512 (m * k) nodecase with different node distribution on the trunk and branch cables. thedistributions are 1 trunk node and 512 branch nodes, 5 trunk nodes and103 nodesper branch, 10 trunk nodes and 51 nodes per branch, 20 trunk nodes and 25 nodesper branch and 40 trunk nodes and 13 nodes per branch. figure 5 shows thedelays related to these different distributions. the following figure shows apacket length of 512 or 2048-bits and a baud rate of 1mbps.figure 2 shows that with a fixed baud rate, (1mbps) and a fixed packet size(512 or 2048 bits), the throughput (total number of packets) on each branchcable is almost identical. therefore, the total throughput of the system withina given time is expressed in the following equation.as the value, num_packets_per_branch is almost identical to the same valuesfor g and s on each branch cable, it seems clear that putting thecontrol node(s) on the trunk cable will linearly increase the throughput forthe entire network. in this case, the implementation of an intelligent node onthe trunk cable resulted in the desired performance. since slotted aloha candouble the throughput on each branch, we can see that the total throughput isalso doubled. this implies that the better the protocol on the branch level,the more the total system throughput increases.figure 3 shows that the delay time may be reduced even if the number of trunkcontrol nodes increases. the following equation shows that the delayis mainly caused by two factors: the size of waiting queue and theretransmission rate (g), which is what queuing theory would predict. ifthere are too many messages at the trunk control nodes waiting to betransmitted, the delay will increase. this means that if the traffic is greaterthan trunk capacity, the store and forward protocol on truck level will cause along delay and deteriorate overall system performance.conclusionsthe results from the current study lead us to a number of conclusionsregarding the use of a two-level distributed intelligence approach to usingcatv equipment to support metropolitan area networking. briefly stated, theyare:adding control nodes on the trunk cable (increasing m) will reduce thedelay with the number of uses (subscribers) in the system being fixed.proper values for the average transmission success rate (s) and averagetransmission attempts (g) will also tend to increase the throughput.increasing the baud rate, tends to reduce the packet_time, and therefore has apositive effect in reducing the waiting_queue_size, which in turn reduces thedelay (see figure 5).interestingly, increasing the baud rate beyond a certain limit tends to causethe waiting_queue_size to increase. consequently the packet_time is reduced andthe delay time increases (see figure 5). essentially, our ability to reduce the delay time is a function of the trunkcable's transmit rate (bit rate) and the packet_length. increasing the value ofm will not cause the delay time to be increased because the throughputon each branch is effectively fixed and has a normal distribution probability.therefore, the more nodes (users) on a branch, the less frequently each branchnode can send a packet onto branch cable as the throughput on each branch isfixed. as a result, to the extent that a trunk node can handle the traffic, thewaiting queue size will not increase and the delay time will not increase.the model clearly demonstrates that our design is extendable: we can increasethe number of users by simply adding trunk control nodes to increase the systemthroughput without increasing the average system delay. this is an importantresult as it tells us that a small number of trunk nodes, which are inexpensiveand simple to install, have a dramatic impact on overall network performance.our results were obtained using a baud rate of 1mbps - using a more realisticfigure in the range of 4mbps could only enhance our findings.

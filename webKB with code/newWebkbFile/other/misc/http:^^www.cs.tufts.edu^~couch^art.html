alva couch's photography gallery

i am an avid amateur landscape photographer working in 35mm, medium
format, and 4x5.  remarkably for a computer science professor, i work 
mainly with film and employ a minimum of electronics in pursuing 
this pastime.  time (as well as the lack of a transparency scanner)
permits only a small sampling. i have also done a small amount of 
digital photography (with a fairly primitive
camera).

sand isn't always sandy; my footprints in a muddy, silty sand were deep as
my calves.

an abandoned fort at fort point, nahant. 


sunset at the nahant fort brings out detail in the surrounding rocks and blues

earlier light.

cps 410 late point policy 
 cps 410 laboratory late points policy 

all programming assignments will have a due date specified.
after the due date, late assignment points will be reduced
by 20% per day.  saturdays and sundays are not included.  thus,
after one week late, an assignment will be worth 0 points.
all assignments must be turned in and/or demonstrated in your 
next regularly scheduled lab after completion.

the "last change" date of a file will be used to determine
late points.  consequently you should never examine a file 
with an editor after a due date.  use either "more filename"
or make a copy of the file and examine only the copy.

you may check the dates of your files with 

                  checkdate   filename 

which is available in the ~cps410 directory.

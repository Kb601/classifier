the high-performance computing and software laboratory at the
university of texas at san antonio was established in early 1993.
it has
been equipped with sufficient resources to allow extensive study
of high-performance computing for systems and scientific applications.
this laboratory is supporting a variety of
research projects investigating both the fundamental nature of
high-performance computing and its application to problems of importance in
software development.
the principal research efforts are:


 developing efficient algorithms and methods for solving
large-scale
real-world  scientific applications  on various
high performance computing
facilities;


 studying and
evaluating  parallel system performance for efficient architecture design
and scientific program implementations; 


 building  software visualization tools and environment for
high performance scientific applications  and performance evaluation; and


 addressing parallel computing and system issues of  
 heterogeneous networks of workstations (now).

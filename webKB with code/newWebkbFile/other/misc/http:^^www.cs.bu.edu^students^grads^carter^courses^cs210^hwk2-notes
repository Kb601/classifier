<< operator to shift bits to the left.  the places
		on the right will be filled with zeros.
	use the | (or) operator to "or" two bit patterns together.
		this is a good way to combine bit patterns.
	use the & operator along with a "mask" bit pattern to set
		certain bits to 0.   

for example, to put the number -7 into a bit field from position 14 to
18 in the instruction:

	int instr;    /* the instruction */
	int num	      /* the number; contains the value -7, say */

	/* at the outset num contains 11111111111111111111111111111001 */

	/* first mask all bits to 0 except those we want to keep */
	/* this is a pattern of 5 1's since we want to keep 5 bits */
	num = num & 0x1f;

	/* now num contains 00000000000000000000000000011001 */

	/* now shift the bits to their proper location */
	num = num << 14;

	/* now num contains 00000000000001100100000000000000 */

	/* now "or" them into the instruction */
	instr = instr | num;	


finally, when you have filled all the bitfields in the instruction,
write the bits to stdout as follows:

	fwrite(&instr, sizeof(instr), 1, stdout);

frequently asked questions about the sparc assembler project:
--
when i run the program i get "illegal instruction (core dumped)".  does
this mean that my assembler is not converting the assembly file
correctly into machine code?  

exactly.   your assembler generated a bit pattern that the processor cannot
interpret as an instruction.
--
is there any way i can look at the machine code produced by my assembler
program?  

there are two ways.   first, use "od -x":

% od -x fib.ao
0000000 9de3bfc0 a0080010 a2102001 a6102001
0000020 a8100018 10800006 01000000 a4040011
0000040 a0100011 a2100012 a604e001 80a4c014
0000060 06bffffb 01000000 b0100012 81c7e008
0000100 81e80000

the lefthand column is the byte adress of the first word, in octal.  the
other columns are the binary words in your machine language file.

an even more useful thing to do is to ask gdb to tell you what
instructions you have generated, using gdb's "disassemble" command.

load the "runner" into gdb, set a breakpoint at the line that calls
"pgm", run the program (hitting the breakpoint), use "si" until gdb tells
you you are in the subroutine you've written, which is called pgm(),
then "disass" the subroutine (your code).

you should look at the source for "runner" to see how it works to
understand why this works.

what's going to happen when we try to stick a 32 bit number into a 22 
bit spot, like in a format 2 .... or in format 3, put a 32 bit immediate 
into a spot that's too small for it? also, if the address in format 1 is 
negative, using 2's complement don't we need all those bits?

take the case of moving a 32 bit number into a 22 bit field.  first
assume the number is positive.  it's ok to throw away the high 10 bits
if they are all zero, right?  that is, if the actual value contained in
the 32-bit field can be represented in 22 bits, then the 10 high order
bits are zero anyway.  if the number can't be represented in 22 bits
(bigger than 4m), then there is nothing we can do anyway -- the user has
to be alerted of an error condition.  so, the answer is, make sure the
high order bits are zero, and if they are, throw them away, otherwise
signal an error.

the case of negative numbers is analagous, with 1's replacing 0's in the
high order positions.   if the negative number can be encoded in 22
bits, then the 10 high order bits are all 1's and they can be thrown
away. (think about it -- to get the positive version of the number we
would flip the bits, so those ones would become zeroes).

the "ta" instruction:  this is just one of the family of trap
instructions, which are format 3 instructions.  chapter 8 refers to the
whole set of them as the "ticc" instruction.  instead of using chapter 8
for this instruction, look at p. 386 in appendix c.

how can i send an error message to the terminal if output is redirected?

send your error messages to "stderr" using fprintf:
	fprintf(stderr, "error: bad input\n");

 racquetball and squash. i try to play as often as i can.

  
   
 downhill skiing.   these days, it is mostly "holiday valley, ny",
     and, rarely, "killington", "stove", or "rockies" for us.
 
  
  
 camping and hiking. we (meral, aysegul (daughter), and hazel (a 65-pound
chocolate labrador retriever)) just hiked in the alleghany national forest,
and loved it.

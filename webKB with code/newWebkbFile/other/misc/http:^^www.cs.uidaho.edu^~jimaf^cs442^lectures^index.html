written down, let me know and i'll add it to these pages. the following
lecture notes are postscript (ps) copies (2 per page) of the slides i show in
class. i also include pointers to microsoft powerpoint files (ppt) for
those without a postscript printer or viewer. please see the viewing information file for more information

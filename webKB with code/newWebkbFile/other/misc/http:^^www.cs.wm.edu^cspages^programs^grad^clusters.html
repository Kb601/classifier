the computational science cluster
(revised 11-1-96)


background


with the advent of inexpensive networked scientific workstations, a
corresponding dramatic growth in the amount of inexpensive quality
scientific software, and the development of increasingly more
comprehensive and computationally tractable system models, computational
science has emerged as no less than a new way to do science -- a natural
merging of theory and experiment at the computational level. as a
discipline, computational science is concerned with the computational
aspects of modeling, simulating and analyzing the behavior of natural or
man-made systems;  the emphasis is on the use and development of
computational techniques to better understand the behavior of systems. 
consistent with this, a computational science cluster at the college has
been formed that may eventually involve faculty from a wide variety of
departments in the school of arts and sciences, and from the schools of
marine science and business.  the potential to share computational
resources and build intellectual cross-disciplinary affiliations is large,
at both the faculty and graduate student level. 


definition


at the faculty level the cluster is composed of affiliated faculty. 
affiliated faculty normally demonstrate a history of using and developing
computational methods in a scientific way to model, simulate and analyze
the behavior of natural or man-made systems.  in the absence of this
history, the cluster will provide the intellectual resources for
interested faculty to develop a computational science expertise.  the
cluster is administered by an acting director and a cluster committee. the
director and all members of the cluster committee are affiliated faculty
members.  together, they are working to expand the existing computational
strengths (people, hardware, and software) at the college with an emphasis
on the enhancement of advanced undergraduate-level and graduate-level
interdisciplinary research and instruction. 


undergraduate interaction


there is not an undergraduate concentration or minor in computational
science.  however, each year cluster-affiliated faculty will offer at
least one upper-level, cross-listed course designed to illustrate the
significant insight and unity that a computational science perspective 
provides when a variety of natural or man-made systems are studied at the
computational level.  moreover, within the framework of their home 
departments, cluster-affiliated faculty are encouraged to integrate
advanced undergraduates into their research working groups and advise
senior research projects with a significant computational science 
component.  


graduate interaction


there is not be an ms or phd degree in computational science.  however,
if a cluster-affiliated faculty member directs the research of a graduate
student in a cluster-affiliated ms-granting or phd-granting department or
school, then the citation "with a specialization in computational science"
will be appended to the ms or phd degree, as appropriate.  beginning in
the 97/98 academic year the cluster will recruit graduate students, in
part as an extension of the recruiting already done by cluster-affiliated
departments/schools with graduate programs, but also on its own.  all
graduate student admission will be into one of the cluster-affiliated
departments/schools.  (a department or school is cluster-affiliated if at
least one of its tenured faculty is cluster-affiliated and the
department/school has agreed to award the "with a specialization in
computational science" citation, when appropriate.)  graduate students
recruited by the cluster will apply to cluster-affiliated departments,
with a computational science interest noted on the application.  each
department will then act on these applications consistent with standard
departmental admission policies.

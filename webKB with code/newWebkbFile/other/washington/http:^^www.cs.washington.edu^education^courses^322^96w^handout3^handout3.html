final exam cse 322

wednesday, march 13, 1996, 2:30 - 4:20

we will use the  inch blue book.  you may use the first
8 pages for your own handwritten notes.

the exam will be comprehensive covering the entire course.

you should have read and understood the following chapters and sections of
sudkamp.
 
chapter 1, all sections.  pay particular attention to to section 1.3,
countable and uncountable sets.

chapter 2, all sections.

chapter 3, all sections.

chapter 4.  we did not cover this chapter in detail.  you should know
and understand the nondeterministic top-down and bottom-up parsing methods.

chapter 5, only section 5.3, useless symbols.  although we did not
cover this section directly, you should read and understand it.  

chapter 6, all sections.  we did not talk much about -nfa's, but
you should know what they are.  sudkamp's approach to showing the
equivalence of dfa's, nfa's, regular expressions, and regular grammars was
different than mine.  nonetheless, try to read and understand his approach.

chapter 7, all sections except section 7.3, the pumping lemma for
regular languages.

chapter 8, all sections except, 8.3 and 8.6.  also remember to study the
dpda too, which is not covered in the book.
 
chapter 9, only sections 9.1 and 9.2.

chapter 11, only sections 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4. and 11.8.  we are not
covering these sections in complete detail, but you should know and
understand what i did in class in these sections.

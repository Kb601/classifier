collaboration

you are free to work with others in interpreting assignments and 
on developing facility with the software tools we will be using.
however, the solutions to the assignments and quizzes/exams are 
expected to be solely your own.        

on the final project, you may work in groups of no more than two
persons.  if you choose to do so, you will need to add one page
to your final write up explaining the exact role that each person
played in the design and execution of the solution.  this sheet
should be signed by both persons involved.


cheating

cheating is a very serious offense.  it will be dealt with in the 
most severe manner allowable under university regulations.  if caught
cheating, you can expect a failing grade and initiation of a cheating
case in the university system.  basically, its an insult to the 
instructor, the department and major program, and most importantly, 
to the person doing the cheating.  just don't.

to avoid creating situations where copying can arise, you should not
ever e-mail or post your design files.  you can post general questions
about interpretation and tool use but limit your comments to these
categories.  if in doubt about what might constitute cheating, just
don't or send the instructor e-mail describing the situation.

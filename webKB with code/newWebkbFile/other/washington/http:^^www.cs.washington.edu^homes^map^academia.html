i've been the teaching assistant for the
	
	graduate ai course in my department.



for my class on 
	
	human-computer interface design, i observed an
	espresso stand in action. then i attempted
	to observe a subject's  mental models
	as he navigated a web site.


i also worked on goldberg, a music composition
assistant as a personal project and for my course in user interfaces.


here's my current office, 
which is in the chateau,
and my late and lamented previous office.

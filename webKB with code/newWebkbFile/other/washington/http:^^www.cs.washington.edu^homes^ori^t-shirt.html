t-shirt design




i made this t-shirt design for the mp/multimedia group at intel during
the summer of 1996.  the "4-core 1-cache pentium pro" designates the
mp part of the group and the parallel nature of multimedia isa
extensions such as mmx (ofcourse intel is not working on any such
cpu--this is just a joke...).  the cool cafe and dinosaurs designate
the multimedia part of the group.

(thanks to p. kromann for the trick on this one)
a dpda for the given language:  



the computation of abbac:


 
 where
,
, , 
and the function  consists of only these rules:


 
here's a turing machine that accepts :



here's a brief description of  all the states:
 : read the first blank.
 : this is the start of the match loop.  it looks for an a 
or a b.  if it sees a c, then we're done matching the first string.
 : we've read a b and we're looking for the c.
 : we've read an a and we're looking for the c.
 : we're trying to match the b.
 : we're trying to match the a.
 : scan left for the c.
 : scan left for the next thing to match in the first string.
 : verify that there is no other input in the second string.
 : we've matched everything in the first string and found 
nothing else in the second string, so accept the input.

its computation of the input abcab:



let .  assume all the productions in p, not of the form
, are numbered 1 to m.

the pda  will accept
the language generated by g.  we need to specify q and .

the function  consists of the following rules:

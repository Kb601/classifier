introduction to tcas ii,
u.s. department of transportation, federal aviation administration,
march 1990:



after many years of extensive analysis, development, and flight
evaluation by the federal aviation administration and the aviation
industry, a solution is available to the problem of reducing the risk
of midair collisions between aircraft.  this solution is known as the
traffic alert and collision avoidance system (tcas).

tcas is a family of airborne devices that function independently of the
ground-based air traffic control (atc) system, and provide collision 
avoidance protection for a borad spectrum of aircraft types.

tcas i provides proximity warning only, to assist the pilot in the
visual acquisition of intruder aircraft.  it is intended for use by
smaller commuter aircraft and by general aviation aircraft.

tcas ii provides traffic advisories and resolution advisories
(recommended escape maneuvers) in a vertical direction to avoid
conflicting traffic.  airline aircraft, and larger commuter and
business aircraft, use tcas ii equipment.

tcas iii, which is still under development, will provide traffic
advisories and resolution advisories in the horizontal as well as the
vertical direction to avoid conflicting traffic.

the tcas concept makes use of the radar beacon transponders
routinely carried by aircraft for ground atc purposes.  the level of
protection provided by tcas equipment depends on the type of
transponder the target aircraft is carrying.  it should be noted that
tcas provides no protection against aircraft that do not have an
operating transponder.



 a sample display (obtained from here).
the little white cross in the lower-middle of the display is the
aircraft that this display is on.  the little red square at starboard
is another aircraft that tcas ii has issued a resolution advisory on,
i.e., it is considered a ``threat''.  the +03 over the
threat indicates that the threat is 300 feet above this aircraft.  this
visual resolution advisory is accompanied by an aural advisory, such as
``descend, descend.''





 tcas ii was originally specified by a minimal operational
performance standard, abbreviated as--you guessed it--mops.  the
mops is composed of two volumes.  volume i is a textual description of
the overall system, including hardware and communications algorithms.
volume ii defines the collision-avoidance logic, and is a combination
of textual description and pseudocode (called e), the text
describing the code.  the pseudocode is actually divided into
``high-level'' and ``low-level'' logic, so the logic is presented in
three different ways.  the text and high-level logic are not
rigorously defined, so the low-level logic is the standard with which
avionics manufacturers must comply.  here is an example of tcas ii
low-level logic:


process no_weaken_test;

    if (wl.status ne $new)
        then if (itf.reverse eq $true)
                   then noweaken_time = p.trvsnoweak;
                   else noweaken_time = p.tnoweak;
             if (eval(tf.permtent) le eval(owntent))
                  then if (itf.taur gt max(p.strofir, p.frthr(itf.lev,itf.ifirm))
                             then owntent = tf.permtent;
             elseif (tf.permtent(4,5) eq '10')
                   then call check_projection
                          in (itf.rz, g.alim, owntent)
                          out (inthr);
                        if (inthr eq $true)
                             then owntent = tf.permtent;
                             else if ((g.tcur-itf.tcmd) lt noweaken_time
                                       or itf.ifirm lt p.minfirm)
                                       then owntent = tf.permtent;
             otherwise if ((g.tcur-itf.tcmd) lt noweaken_time or
                            itf.ifirm lt p.minfirm)
                            then owntent = tf.permtent;

end no_weaken_test;

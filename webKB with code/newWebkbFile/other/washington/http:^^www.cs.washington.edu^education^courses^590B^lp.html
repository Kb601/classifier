linear programming


oops... chuck was sick.  ronen subbed in without slides.  here's the
notes he spoke from:


- define linear programming  (nr 10.8.1-10.8.5)

    objective function
    nonnegative values (amount of stuff).
        combinatorial hard
        polynomial hard

    define quadratic programming (m 1.11)
        np hard
        algorithms for psd case
        (example? mimum distance, m p.26,27)

- geometric interpretation
    simplex
    solution on the boundary -- at a vertex
    (no solution if it's open and maximum "spills"

- define:
    feasible vector
    feasible basic vector (vertex)

   (no feasible vectors if it's overconstrained)

- combinatorial problem: which vertex?


- slack variables.  turn inequalities into equalities.
  turn things into standard form.



- techniques:
    simplex method -- generally fast, worst-case exponential
        searches vertices
    ellipsoid method -- provably polynomial, impractical
        closes in on vertices
    karmakar -- provably polynomial, arguably practical
        searches interior points


- do simplex method for reduced form. (nr 10.8.8, 10.8.9)


- define linear complementary problem (m 1.6-1.8)
    note:  square matrix
           choice of w or z is 0

           no objective function!


- turn lp into lcp (m 1.9-1.10)

- turn lcp into quadratic
    (trivial: minimize sum of w.z.  better be 0!)

- can also turn quadratic into lcp.
    (too hard!)

in the above,

     nr refers to numerical recipes
     m refers to k.g.murty, linear complementarity

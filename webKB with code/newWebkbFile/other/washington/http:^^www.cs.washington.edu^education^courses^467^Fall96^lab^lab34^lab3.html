objectives
after completing this lab you will know how to:

use synario to construct hierarchical circuit schematics
include abel programs in schematics as devices
debug synchronous designs using simulation
program plds
debug physical circuits
-->


from now on, you will be working (sometimes rather loosely) in teams
of four.  the first part of this assignment has you follow a tutorial
where you should work in groups of two.  in the second part you are
given a circuit that divides naturally into two parts, each of which
can be solved individually by half the team and then linked together
to form a complete solution.

note: although the tutorial is rather complete, you may need to
look in the synario manuals in the lab to answer questions you may
have or to use more advanced features.

i. tutorial: topdown design using abel with schematics 

this tutorial has you design a counter that counts 1,2,3,..,n where n
is an input to the counter.  this counter is composed of two component
modules, a simple counter and a comparator.  the comparator compares
the endcount to the current count value and causes the counter to
restart.

note: you will not be following the tutorial exactly, but we
will let you know where things diverge.

ii. design problem: serial communication

you are to construct a sequential circuit that interfaces a simple
keypad to an lcd screen.  characters to be printed on the lcd screen
will be keyed in using two key presses: one for the first 4-bit nibble
of the character's code and one for the second 4-bit nibble.  for
example, to print an "a" one would key in a "4" and a "1".

the circuit you design will communicate values from the keypad to the
lcd display using your solution to homework 2, problem 6, which
presented a method for bit-serial communication.  you will start by
designing and simulating your circuit in synario.  in the next weeks,
you will program parts of your circuit into plds, plug them in and get
the circuit work.

 the figure below shows the components of your system:

(figure 1)

the keypad
the first half of the circuit takes values entered on the keypad and
sends them serially to the second half of the circuit.

the keypad has nine wires: one for each column (5 through 8), one for
each row (1 through 4), and a common wire (9) to be connected to
ground (this is the common connection for all the switches).  when a
key is pressed the corresponding column and row wires are connected to
the common signal (see the figure below).  therefore, the keypad is
called a 2-of-8, 2 of the 8 wires will be active low when a key is
pressed, the others are pulled high through resistor connections to
5v.





the first part of the task is to convert the 2-of-8-bit value from the
keypad wires into a 4-bit value plus a "ready" bit.  the 4-bit value
encodes the key pressed into a binary number (0000 to 1101 for 0
through 9 followed by a, b, c, and d; 1110 for *; and 1111 for #).
the ready bit is synchronized to the clock and is asserted high for
one cycle indicating that a key has been pressed.  the rest of your
circuit will collect two 4-bit values and send them serially according
to our protocal across the link to the lcd display circuit.  also, you
will need to latch (i.e., store in a register) the first key pressed
while you wait for the second so it might be a good idea to just latch
both (this can be done with one or two `373s). 

the lcd screen
the second half of the circuit receives the data sent bit-serially
from the keypad and displays the value on the lcd screen.

the display you will be using has a very straightforward interface.
it takes instructions or data depending on the value of the rs wire.
the table below shows the instructions you will be using.  four
instructions are required to initialize the display for the
configuration we require (a 1 line by 16 character display).  these
are shown in the first four lines of the table.  so your control logic
must be sure to issue these instructions whenever it is reset.

after reset, all you need to do is write characters to the display
(the fifth line in the table).  these will be displayed immediately by
the display unit.  finally, you will hit the reset switch again and
start entering a new number.  you can find the character codes in the
display documentation.


operation	rs	r/w	db7...db0
clear display	0	0	0000 0001
function set	0	0	0011 00**
display on	0	0	0000 1100
entry mode set	0	0	0000 0110
write character	1	0	dddd dddd
backspace	0	0	0001 00**
return home	0	0	0000 000*
read character	1	1	dddd dddd


the timing constraints that must be satisfied when writing information
into the display are quite straightforward.  basically, the display
samples the rs line on the rising edge of the enable signal (e) and db
lines on the falling edge of e.  to keep things simple, the set up and
hold time for rs should be one cycle before and after the rising edge
of e, respectively.  similarly for the db lines and the falling edge
of e.  the only other timing information of importance is to allow up
to 1.6ms for the display to actually clear (the internal controllers
takes some time to actually go and enter 0s in the internal memory of
the display unit).

 since your project does not need to perform read operations, the
r/w control line can be tied directly to gnd.  for normal character
write operations, the rs signal should be 1.  to execute a command,
the rs signal should be 0.  the easiest way to perform a write is by
asserting the enable signal (e) for one clock cycle during which rs
and data are both stable.  you must ensure that the number code is
stable while this is happening.  this shouldn't be a problem as a key
press takes a lot longer than your circuit will need.  however, you
should ensure that rs is stable for a cycle before and after the write
operation is performed.  you will need to do this in your controller's
finite state machine.  since the enable signal is used to clock data
into the display, it should be hazard-free (no spurious glitches).
the easiest way to ensure this is to make it a direct output of a
flip-flop in the pld.

details, details, details... 

part of designing a circuit to solve a problem is defining what the
problem is.  most problem descriptions are hazy, incomplete and
ambiguous.  one of the tasks of when designing is to turn such a
description into a precise specification.  before you begin to design,
ask yourself what is missing and write down as precise a
specification as you can.  you may save yourself a lot of work in the
end.  document both parts of your circuit design (preferably using
word), specifying how the pieces will interact and how you will solve
each part.  include this documentation in your synario project and
hand it in with your schematics.


notes:

 don't forget to provide a reset input to both halves of your
circuit.
 you will have to figure out how to signal the beginning of data
to separate it from idle time.
 decide on a good speed for your clock which suits the lcd
display.  you might as well simulate at your proposed clock speed.
(hint: it should be relatively slow.)


entering and simulating your design

divide each half of your design into reasonably-sized components, such
as registers and counters and combinational logic that can fit in a
single pld.  draw a top-level schematic for your design, including the
components that you need.  (work with your ta if you are not sure how
to define this hierarchy.)  use abel to specify both your sequential
(e.g. counters) and combinational (e.g. code converter) components.
you will find some useful chip definitions in the t:\cse467 directory.
you can use these in your schematics by first importing them, then
creating the matching symbol (the tutorial covers this).  you may want
to do this for other standard chips although you can use plds for most
everything.

 you should simulate your designs separately as best you can, and
then combine the two projects using a new top-level schematic.
(start a new project then import the pieces of the two projects.)
to simulate the complete design, you will need to provide the keypad
stimulus, which is easy to do on eight inputs, and you will need to
check that the commands to the lcd display are correct.  for now, you
will just have to check this by hand.

 here is an example of a verilog test fixture which uses one
process to set the "test vectors" and a separate process to generate a
free-running clock:


// consistently set the timescale (1 ns) and the precision (1 ns)
//    should be set in the top level file (here) because it may be
//    defaulted differently in separate submodules

`timescale 1 ns/1 ns

// declare the toplevel module name

module t;

// include the interface to the schematic and abel source

`include "keypad.tfi"

// initialize the inputs. then form input stimuli.
// because of the way the clock is structured,
//    it is safe to change inputs at times: 0, 100, 200, 300, etc.

initial
begin
   clk = 0;
   reset = 1;
   {r0,r1,r2,r3} = 0;
   {c0,c1,c2,c3} = 0;
   #200 reset = 0;
   #1000 {r0,r1,r2,r3} = {1,0,0,0};
         {c0,c1,c2,c3} = {0,1,0,0};
   #300  {r0,r1,r2,r3} = {0,0,0,0};
         {c0,c1,c2,c3} = {0,0,0,0};
   #300  {r0,r1,r2,r3} = {0,0,1,0};
         {c0,c1,c2,c3} = {0,0,0,1};
   #300  {r0,r1,r2,r3} = {0,0,0,0};
         {c0,c1,c2,c3} = {0,0,0,0};
end

// this clock has a period of 100 ns. the rising edges occur at
//   times 50, 150, 250, etc.

always 
begin
   #50 clk = 1;
   #50 clk = 0;
end

endmodule


extra credit

many other options can be incorporated into this circuit.  for
example, you may want to implement a back-space function using the
code "a0" (10100000).

introduction


seattle is a good city for restaurants.  there are notable restaurants
in all price ranges and for most major cuisines.  seafood is a very
good bet.  a number of restaurants have sprung up that serve what
could be called "northwest cuisine," specializing in fresh local
ingredients.  european restaurants are well represented, with italian
being particularly strong.  there are a large number of thai
restaurants which are consistently good, and a smattering of
vietnamese restaurants.  there are a number of good japanese
restaurants.  in addition to being a good place to eat, seattle is
also a good place to drink: there are several microbreweries that make
very good beers, and northwest wines are gaining increasing
recognition.

many of the restaurants are within walking distance from downtown 
hotels (especially the downtown, pike place market, and some of 
the capitol hill restaurants).   the restaurants listed for pioneer square,
the international district, seattle center, and the eastern reaches of 
captiol hill are further away but still within walking distance; 
you can also, of course, take the bus (the new downtown bus tunnel 
is worth a visit in any case) or a cab.  bus access to the university 
district is particularly easy.

street addresses in seattle are potentially confusing.  seattle is
divided into a number of regions, and the streets are designated with
the appropriate compass points.  in downtown the compass point is
empty.  the compass points are significant, since 1st ave n is
different from 1st ave ne is different from 1st ave nw is different
from 1st ave.  streets generally run east-west and avenues generally
run north-south (although in some areas, such as downtown, east-west
and north-south are used in a weak sense).  both streets and avenues
are numbered, so after a series of wrong turns, you could find
yourself at the corner of 45th and 45th (in fact there are several
different places in the city where you could find yourself at this
intersection).  the compass point comes before an 
(east-west-running) street name, as in n 50th street, 
and after a (north-south-running) avenue name, as in 9th avenue
ne.  this makes the use of "street" and "avenue" redundant, so they
are often omitted.

the restaurants below are open seven days a week unless otherwise
noted, but call to be safe.  restaurants are classified as
inexpensive, inexpensive-moderate, moderate, moderate-expensive, and
expensive.  a listing of restaurants by type of food follows the main
listing.

none of these restaurants will disappoint.  we have marked with an
asterisk (*) restaurants particularly recommended for the
infrequent visitor to seattle.  we should note that these selections 
and the accompanying comments are the personal opinions of various 
members of the department. 




restaurants by location






downtown
  


 dahlia lounge *, 1904 fourth avenue, 682-4142
  moderate-expensive. tom douglas has been a pioneer in northwest cuisine, and 
the food and decor here is eclectic.

 fullers *, seattle sheraton hotel, sixth avenue and pike,
447-5544
  expensive.  consistently one of the highest rated restaurants in
the city.  atmosphere and service are quite formal, at least by seattle 
standards.

 mccormick's fish house, 722 fourth avenue, 682-3900
 moderate-expensive.  very wide range of fresh seafood.  a bit noisy.

 metropolitan grill, 820 second avenue, 624-3287
 moderate-expensive.  a well-regarded steakhouse.  we don't
much like steaks, but you might.

 nikko *, fifth and stewart (westin hotel), 322-4905

moderate-expensive.  historically the best sushi in seattle.
recently transplanted from the international district.

 the painted table, alexis hotel, madison at first avenue
624-3626
  moderate-expensive.  interesting, well-prepared american/northwest 
food in a very  pretty setting.   a good choice for a "typical seattle" top 
restaurant.








pike place market



 campagne, 86 pine, 728-2800
  expensive.  very good french country restaurant. 

  cafe campagne
 a less formal, less expensive version of campagne (above).

 expensive.   tiny restaurant serving northwest cuisine upstairs 
in the market building itself. closed sunday and monday.

  etta's seafood, western near north end of the market, 443-6000

the new incarnation of cafe sport, a less expensive, less formal, 
but still eclectic version of the dahlia lounge also conceived and managed 
by tom douglas.  early reports (and crowds) are extremely positive.

 the pink door, 1919 post alley, 443-3241
  moderate.  cheap wine and decent interesting pasta dishes.  
fun, casual atmosphere, particularly when the outdoor deck is usable.

  moderate.  inside the market, great views, good fresh seafood.

 el puerco lloron, 1501 western avenue (pike place hillclimb)

there and hungry.








adjacent to the market (north and south)
  


 casa-u-betcha, 2212 1st ave, 441-1026
 inexpensive-moderate.  a taco bar for beautiful yuppies.  kind of fun.

 labuznik *, 1924 1st avenue, 682-1624
  expensive.  consistently
one of seattle's best restaurants.  imaginative preparation of meat dishes.

bar area up front. closed sunday and monday.

 lamperia, 2400 1st avenue, 443-3301
  expensive.  exquisitely prepared food, continental / northwest.
some find it too formal, others rave.   serious food, in any case.

  moderate-expensive.  westernized asian.  pleasant, stylish decor.

a number of renovated turn-of-the-century office buildings with many
art galleries and bars/cafes.



 al boccalino *, 1 yesler way, 622-7688
 moderate-expensive. reservations sometimes difficult.
definitely the best italian food in town,
with an un-stuffy atmosphere.  noisy. closed sundays.

 il terrazzo carmine, 411 1st avenue s, 467-7797
  expensive.  classic italian cuisine.  very good food 
in formal atmosphere.  closed sunday.

 trattoria mitchelli, 84 yesler way, 623-3883
  moderate.  open nearly all the
time.  it's only ok italian food, but at 3 a.m. who cares?

 viet my, 129 prefontaine place s, 382-9923
 inexpensive. hole in the wall place with good vietnamese food.








international district
  an area east of the kingdome surrounding uwajimaya, the superb asian 
supermarket.

seattle serving real taiwanese food.  closed sunday-tuesday.

 moderate-expensive.  not great decor, but really good food.

 house of hong, 409 8th ave s, 622-7997

 inexpensive.  good vietnamese (predominantly northern). 

 mikado *, 514 s jackson street, 622-5206

closed sunday.

 ocean city restaurant, 609 s weller, 623-2333
 good for dim sum.

 french/italian/eclectic food, all very interesting.  a small, 
very friendly,  informal room, where you will get to meet the 
owner (and he may well sing opera for you if things are slow).
always a very pleasant evening.

lake union
  
these restaurants are located on both sides of lake union.


 adriatica, 1107 dexter avenue n, 285-5000

excellent italian and yugoslavian food.  but perhaps the best
feature is the dark, quiet bar up on the third floor overlooking
lake union.

  (south end of lake union.)  moderate-expensive.
fresh seafood with a nice view over lake union.

  despite the silly name, good sushi at reasonable prices.

 rattlers grill *, 1823 eastlake ave e, 325-7350
  (east side of lake union.)  moderate.
a good, fun, southwestern ("new mexican") restaurant.








university district
  
probably the best way to choose a restaurant in the 
university district is to go to the ave (university 
way) and walk until you see something that tempts you.


 big time brewing company, 4133 university way ne
  brew pub with decent sandwich-style food.

 toscana, 1312 ne 43rd st, 547-7679 (in the alley), moderate,
  italian.  the most formal (and most expensive) restaurant in the

a "bigger occasion" sort of place.

 inexpensive.  ethiopian.  closed monday.

 moderate.  excellent spanish / (new) mexican.

 cafe flora *, 2901 e madison, 325-9100
 moderate.  vegetarian cooking raised to new heights.

but you can wait in the tavern next door.

 rovers *, 2808 e madison, 325-7442
  expensive.  outstanding, semi-formal, french-inspired northwest
cuisine.  small portions.

 sostanza, 1927 43rd e, 324-9701
  moderate.
pleasant italian restaurant with interesting food.

northwest cuisine in town.  a must for the serious foodie.

  ponti seafood grill, 3014 3rd ave n, 284-3000
 moderate-expensive.  just south of fremont bridge, 
with nice view of the boats.  excellent nw/seafood.

 ray's boathouse *, 6049 seaview nw, expensive, 789-3770
  seafood with a great view.  reservations are difficult.
the upstairs portion of the restaurant 
(ray's cafe) does not
take reservations, has much of the main menu, has a more relaxed
atmosphere, and is much cheaper.  go there; definitely worth the trip
on a nice evening.








elsewhere




 bai tong, 15859 pacific highway s,
seatac (by the airport!), 431-0893
  the best thai food in the area.

	you may remember seeing a full-page ad in a national magazine,
	placed by the tobacco manufacturer philip morris, featuring
	not the rugged marlboro man but franklin d. roosevelt. the
	former president is quoted, "those who have long enjoyed such
	privileges as we enjoy forget in time that men have died to
	win them." as george gerbner observed, if smoking really is a
	privilege, many more have died enjoying the privilege than
	ever died fighting for it.

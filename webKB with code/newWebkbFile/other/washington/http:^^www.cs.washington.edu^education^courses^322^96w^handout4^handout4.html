the halting problem



the halting problem is defined to be:

input: turing machine m and binary input x,

property: m halts on input x.


 theorem: the halting problem is undecidable.

 proof:  the proof is by contradiction.  
suppose that the halting problem is decidable.
then there must be a turing machine h with the
property that h halts on all inputs, and accepts  if and only if 
m halts on input x.
(recall that  is the binary representation of the turing machine m.)

we define a new turing machine d which does the following on inputs of
the form .

copy the input  to form the string .

run h on the input .

if h halts without accepting then d halts.

if h halts and accepts then d simply loops forever.


there are two possibilities, d halts on input  or d does
not halt on input .
we will come to a contradiction in both cases.

if  d halts on input , then by the definition of h,
h accepts
.  by the definition of d, d does not halt on input .

if  d does not halt on input , then by the definition of h,
h halts on input  without accepting.  
by the definition of d, d halts on input .

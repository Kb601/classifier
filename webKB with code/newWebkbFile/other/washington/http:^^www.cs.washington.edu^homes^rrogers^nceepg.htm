the madrona center is superbly adapted for our needs and we feel extremely fortunate that owner jayne atkinson is so much in tune with our goals and purpose. many of you will remember jayne as the actress who played the part of the boy's mother in the movie free willy. facilities include a large bunkhouse, geodesic dome, and a full kitchen.


each week will include wildlife cruises around the islands, a visit to the whale museum, wolf hollow wildlife rehabilitation center, and westcott bay oyster farm. extra curricular activities will include musical entertainment in the dome, special guest speakers, and games.

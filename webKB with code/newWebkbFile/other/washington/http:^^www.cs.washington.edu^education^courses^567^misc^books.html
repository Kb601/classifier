cse 567: principles of digital systems design 
carl ebeling, fall 1996 

reference texts

unfortunately there is no one book or even two books that cover all of
the material in this course.  the slides and handouts will contain
everything we talk about in class, but you may want to consult some of
the following texts for specific topics.  all of the following texts
except sternheim are on reserve in the engineering library.  in
addition, i have put several of my own digital design books in the lis
lab (sieg 424).  please don't take them out of the lab.

there are many texts that cover digital design.  katz[1] has
become a standard text and discusses the role of cad and programmable
devices.  wakerly[5] is a more traditional nuts-and-bolts
text that uses standard parts, but it has lots of good examples and
exercises.  mccluskey[2] gives a more formal treatment of
logic design.

ward and halstead[6] contains lots of material presented at a
fairly basic level.  about half the topics covered in class are
covered to some extent in this book.

there are no really good books on verilog and hardware design
languages.  both thomas[4] and sternheim[3] are
reasonable standard texts though.

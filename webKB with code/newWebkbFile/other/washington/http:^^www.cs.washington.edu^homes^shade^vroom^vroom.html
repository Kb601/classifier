vroom - virtual reality room - siggraph 94





















visualization of climate data over the western united states








vroom - virtual reality room, was an exhibit held at siggraph 94
by the folks from the electronic visualization lab

(evl)

at the university of illinois at chicago. the idea was to give
siggraph attendees exposure to "real life" problems that could
be solved using virtual reality technology. there were 4 rooms of
exhibits: 3 of the rooms had caves, and the fourth room was
stocked with booms. most of the projects that were run in the
caves, including mine, were focused on scientific visualization.
the cave is an awesome and compelling experience. no other
publically available virutal reality hardware can match the
realism and degree of immersion offered by the cave. to find
out more about the specifics of the cave, visit the

cave homepage.

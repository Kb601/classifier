note: as always, you are free to work on any platform, but it
is your responsibility to make sure what you hand in works on the cs
instructional machines (lynx, wolf or grizzly).  the source code
provided throughout the quarter will be written in c.  you are free to
use c++, but it will not be supported.







the turnin program is now accepting the intermdiate
submission for project 4 and the java extra credit assignment.

project 1.

 queue.c (here's my version of queuetest.c)
 timegetpid.c




notes: when using gettimeofday, you get back a
value in seconds and microseconds.  if you want to time something, you
will need to call gettimeofday twice, once to get the start
time, start_tp, and again to get the ending time,
end_tp.  to find the elapsed time, it is not enough to
subtract the seconds field of start_tp from the seconds field
of end_tp and similarly with the microseconds field (you can
get an incorrect value for the number of seconds and a negative value
for the microseconds).  you must first convert to a common unit,
either a floating point value of seconds or an integer value of
microseconds, and then do the subtraction.


  start = (double) start_tp->tv_sec + ((double) start_tp->tv_usec)*(1.0e-6);
  end = (double) end_tp->tv_sec + ((double) end_tp->tv_usec)*(1.0e-6);

  elapsed_time = end - start;




project 2.


below is my solution for the preemptive minithread system.  i
implemented spinlocks and had a few extra header files.  notice that
if you actually destroy threads in semaphore_destroy, you
need a special destroy routine that doesn't actually stop the thread
(like the one you use to destroy threads in your minithread system).
look for minithread_destroy and
minithread_destroy_internal in minithread.c and synch.c to see the difference.




 minithread.c (minithread package)
 synch.c (semaphore implementation)
 my_malloc.c (safe malloc)
 spinlock.c and spinlock.h (spinlocks)
 and a few extra header files: panic.h (for errors), minithread_export.h (other exported routines)




for the bounded buffer problem, i use three semaphores:
empty_s and full_s to synchronize the producers and
consumers, and pool_s to manage accesses to the buffer pool.
in addition, i provide three command line options that enable the user
to choose the number of producers, the number of consumers and the size
of the buffer pool (this was not part of the assignment).




 boundbuf.c




for the cigarette problem, i use four semaphores: an array
needed, one for each ingredient and empty to
indicate that there is nothing on the table.  the way to think of this
is that each of the three smokers (each has a different ingredient)
p's on a semaphore that is signalled when the other two ingredients
are there.  the agent randomly v's on one of these semaphores.  i also
provided three command line options that allow you to control the
agent.  in particular, by default the agent puts ingredients on the
table, each with equal probability, i.e., in the limit, each
smoker will smoke about the same number of cigarettes.  the ratio of
smokers smoking is 1:1:1.  you can use the command line
options to change this ratio (this was not part of the assignment).

which versions of nt and win95 are supported?

this port is known to run on all versions of nt up to 4.0 (including
with the beta win95 shell) on all nt hardware platforms, and on
windows 95 beta version 347 and later versions.  this port is built
using the win32 api and supports most of the features of the unix
version.  (note that this port does not work with win32s, and i do not
know enough about win32s to know whether it is either possible or even
worth trying.) 

msdos and windows 3.11

eli zaretskii &lteliz@is.elta.co.il&gt maintains the port of gnu emacs
for msdos and ms windows.  you can download precompiled versions
with the latest djgpp archives:


ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/emacs.readme
ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/em1934*.zip


eli strongly recommends that you start with the emacs.readme file --
it contains crucial info about what's in the other 10 zip files and
how to install them and get started with emacs on msdos/ms-windows
platforms. 

more from eli:


it might be of interest to windows users that this version of emacs
supports long filenames (windows 95 only) and the windows clipboard (all
versions of ms-windows).  it also supports multiple frames, but they all
overlap, like when emacs runs on a ``glass teletype'' terminal. 

people who would like to run emacs on plain dos (as opposed to windows)
will need to download and install a dpmi host at this url: 

ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2misc/csdpmi3b.zip


mule

hisashi miyashita &lthimi@bird.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp&gt maintains mule,
multilingual emacs.  you can get distributions of mule at ftp://ftp.tokyonet.ad.jp/pub/pc/misc/mule2.3-win32. 


changes between 19.32/33/34 and 19.31.

 as far as emacs on nt/win95 are concerned, 19.32, 19.33, and 19.34
(released within weeks of each other) are essentially the same. 



 emacs now loads winsock.dll dynamically to get around the problem
where starting emacs would force a network connection to be made on
machines configured to use the dialup network.


	 two new functions, win32-has-winsock and
win32-unload-winsock, determine whether winsock has been loaded
(and load it if not), and unload winsock, respectively.

	 the registry entry preload_winsock can be set to have
winsock loaded when emacs starts up (for machines that are always
connected to the network).


 bug fixes to the rename function which, on win95, does some
shuffling to overcome a bug in movefile.  if the new name is only
different in case to the old name, the old file is not deleted.  also,
the temporary file name now uses a long extension to ensure that win95
names the renamed file properly.

 the alt key can now be used to generate the alt modifier
(default use of alt is to generate the meta modifier).  new
variable win32-alt-is-meta, when non-nil, has alt generate the
alt modifier.

 emacs now repaints the backgrounds properly when occluded.

 fixed-width fonts of any quality or precision are now allowed.

 dos processes restricted on nt as well as win95.

 bug fix to mouse positioning.

 driver letters now always lower-cased.

 improvements to keyboard handling.  emacs no longer loses
modifier key state when switching back and forth among applications.
it now also processes valid keys that are produced using altgr with
dead keys.  the strange behavior of emacs hanging when c-g is pressed
repeatedly upon startup in console mode has also been fixed.

 new variable win32-downcase-file-names.  when non-nil,
upper case filenames are converted to lower case.

 dos subprocesses no longer can be killed via signals.

 improvements to shell-mode.  


	it can now complete filenames that include '/' or '\' as
the path separator, and defaults to '\' as the path separator for
completed names.

	it can also expand environment variable references using
the %env_var% syntax.

	it does a better job at following directory changes,
although it can still get confused as you switch among drives.


 the smtpmail.el file is now in the standard distribution.

 vc-mode now properly quotes checkin messages.

 tags files are now computed and loaded as text.

 the wakeup program has been removed (across all platforms) now
that emacs internally supports timers.




how do i get an emacs distribution?

emacs is distributed in two different forms.  you can get the full
source distribution of emacs, or you can get an installed distribution
of emacs with all executables precompiled.

where can i get the source distribution?

the latest source distribution can be found in ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/latest/src. it
is distributed in two formats: one large gzipped tar file
(emacs*.tar.gz), and a collection of smaller zip files that can be
copied to 1.44 mbyte floppies (em-src-_?.zip).

in the same directory you should also find patch files that enable you
to upgrade source distributions to the latest version.  these patch
files are mirrors of the ones on the fsf server at ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu. 

where can i get precompiled versions?

precompiled versions always exist for nt-i386 and win95.  when i
receive contributed precompiled versions from other users on the other
platforms, i place them in the appropriate directory.  so if the link
ends in an empty or nonexistant directory, then i haven't received any
precompiled executables for that platform.  in this case, if you have
a microsoft compiler, then you can download the source and compile it
(and if you do, please consider contributing your executables; send me
mail and we can make arrangements for making them available on my ftp
server). 

links to precompiled versions: 


i386: ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/latest/i386
mips: ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/latest/mips
alpha: ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/latest/alpha
ppc: ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/latest/ppc
win95: ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/latest/i386 (i386 is both nt and win95)


i've had numerous reports from people outside north america stating
that their ftp connection aborts for no apparent reason roughly a
third of the way through a transfer of a full distribution.  marc
haber (s_haber@ira.uka.de) said that he suffered from the same
problem, and later found that a timeout configured into his www proxy
would cancel the transfer when the link to the us was very busy.
going around his proxy solved the problem.  other than that, i have
not been able to figure out why this might be the case.  if this
happens to you, you might consider trying to download it in the 1.44
mb chunks, or try one of the mirror sites.  also, if you have access
to a standalone ftp client (separate from your web browser), you
should definitely try that as well. 

mirror sites with precompiled versions:



ireland:
ftp://ftp.ucc.ie/pub/emacs (all)

australia:
http://www.plugged.net.au/gnu/ntemacs (i386)

north america (east coast):
http://www.itribe.net/virtunix/emacs (i386)






how do i unpack the distributions?

decide on a directory in which to place emacs.  move the distribution
to that directory, and then unpack it.  if you have the gzipped tar
version, first use gunzip to uncompress the tar file, and then use tar
with the "xvfm" flags to extract the files from the tar file:


	% gunzip -c -d emacs.tar.gz | tar xvfm -


the "-d" flag forces gunzip to decompress (its behavior depends upon
the name of the executable, and sometimes it doesn't recognize that it
is really gunzip), and the "-c" flag tells it to pipe its output to
stdout.  similarly, the "-" flag to tar tells it to read the tar file
from stdin.  unpacking the distribution this way leaves the
distribution in compressed form so it takes up less space.  

if for some reason you also want to have the tar file gunzipped, then
invoke gunzip without the -c option: 


	% gunzip -d emacs.tar.gz


if you have the zip version, use unzip with the "-x" flag on all of
the .zip files (note that you cannot use pkunzip on these files, as
pkunzip will not preserve the long filenames): 


	% unzip -x emacs-_1.zip
	% (repeat for the remaining .zip files)


you can find precompiled versions of all of the compression and
archive utilities in ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/utilities. 

warning: some
utilities that handle tar files can incorrectly untar the
distributions when using the default settings.  if you encounter
problems with emacs, see the section below on troubleshooting these problems. 

now what?

you should find a file named readme as a part of the distribution.  be
sure to read this file for information on installing emacs, as well as
reading the section below on installing
emacs. 

 
i don't want the precompiled version. how
do i compile emacs myself?

to compile emacs, you will need a microsoft c compiler package.  for
nt, this can be any of the sdk compilers from nt 3.1 and up, microsoft
visual c++ for nt (versions 1.0 and up), or microsoft visual c++
(versions 2.0 and up).  for windows 95, this can be microsoft visual
c++ versions 2.0 and up. 

download and place the source distribution in a directory (say,
c:\emacs).  unpack the distribution, and go to the nt subdirectory of
the emacs directory that gets created in the unpacking process.  read
the readme and install files included with the distribution for the
full details of this process. 

below are known problems with various combinations of emacs versions
and compiler versions.  the problems are being addressed in later
versions, and are included here so that you know to expect them and
how to work around them: 

emacs 19.29.1 and msvc 2.2



win32.mak: for some reason, the msvc 2.2 installation process
does not install win32.mak, which is included by the file ntwin32.mak.
you'll have to copy over the win32.mak file into the msvc include
directory before the emacs makefiles will work. 

processor_* macros: although the processor_* macros are defined
in the manual, msvc 2.2 no longer defines the full set of processor_*
macros in winnt.h.  you'll have to comment the macros out in nt\nt.c
to get nt.c to compile. 




how do i install emacs?


precompiled distribution 



preferred method: 

let's assume that the directory in which you have unpacked emacs is
c:\emacs (note that it can be anything you want it to be; i just want
to be able to refer to something concrete at this point).  first, you
will want to run the program bin\addpm.exe with the emacs
directory as an argument.  in this example you would invoke it as: 


	c:\emacs\bin\addpm.exe c:\emacs


invoking addpm.exe will do two things.  first, it will create a set of
registry keys that tell emacs where to find its support files (lisp,
info, etc.).  second, it will create a folder containing an icon
linked to runemacs.exe (a wrapper program for invoking emacs). 

now, to run emacs, simply click on the icon in the newly created
folder or invoke runemacs.exe from a command prompt. 

alternate method: 

another alternative for running emacs is to use the emacs.bat
batch file in the bin directory (this is now the old method of
invoking emacs).  edit the emacs.bat file to change the emacs_dir
environment variable to point to the emacs installation directory and
invoke the emacs.bat file to run emacs. (if you use bash as your
shell, you can use an equivalent
bash script to emacs.bat.) 

note that, on win95, you are likely to get "out of environment space"
messages when invoking the emacs.bat batch file.  the problem is that
the console process in which the script is executed runs out of memory
in which to set the emacs environment variables.  to get around this
problem, create a shortcut icon to the emacs.bat script.  then right
click on the icon and select properties.  in the dialog box that pops
up, select the memory tab and then change the environment memory
allocation from "auto" to "1024".  close the dialog box and then
double click on the icon to start emacs. 

source distribution

you have two options for installing emacs with the source
distribution.  you can install it over the source directory, or you
can install it in a completely separate directory.  emacs works the
same with either installation option.  one advantage of installing it
over the source directory is that it takes up far less disk space
(primarly because the lisp files don't have to be copied).  one
advantage of installing emacs in a separate directory is that emacs
can now be managed as a single unit that can be moved and copied
independently of the source code. 

the install_dir macro in the nt\makefile.def makefile
determines where emacs will get installed from the source
distribution.  if you want to install emacs in the same directory as
the source tree (say, c:\src\emacs), then simply set install_dir
appropriately:

	install_dir = c:\src\emacs


if you want to install emacs in a different directory (say, c:\emacs),
then set install_dir to this directory:

	install_dir = c:\emacs


as compared with the installation process for the precompiled version,
the installation process will automatically create a bin\emacs.bat
file in the installation tree with the emacs_dir variable set
appropriately.




when i run emacs, nothing happens.  
what's the deal?

emacs could have failed to run for a number of reasons.  the most
common symptom is that, when emacs is started, the cursor changes for
a second but nothing happens.  if this happens to you, it is quite
likely that the distribution was unpacked incorrectly.  if you are
using 19.31 on a machine that uses dialup networking, then it is also
possible that emacs is trying to resolve your machine's domain name as
winsock.dll is being loaded.  

see the next section for more info on working around this problem;
check for the following to see if there was a problem during
unpacking: 



be sure to disable the cr/lf translation or the executables will
be unusable.  older versions of winzipnt would enable this translation
by default.  if you are using winzipnt, disable it.  

check that filenames were not truncated to 8.3.  for example,
there should be a file lisp\term\win32-win.el; if this has been
truncated to win32-wi.el, your distribution has been corrupted while
unpacking and emacs will not start. 

i've been told that some utilities (winzip again?) don't create
the lock subdirectory.  the lock subdirectory needs to be created. 

i've also had reports that the gnu-win32 tar corrupts the
executables.  use the version of tar on my ftp site instead.  



if you are in doubt about whether the utilities you used unpacked the
distribution incorrectly, use the gunzip, tar, and unzip executables
provided in the utilities directory.  these are the ones i use to
create and test the distributions.  my advice would be to use these
utilities from the start.  

if you feel certain that you have unpacked the distribution correctly,
then you should check to make sure that the emacs_dir
variable in the emacs.bat file is set correctly.  if it is and you are
still having trouble, make sure that it is an absolute path that
includes the drive letter (or is in unc format). 

if it is still not working, send me mail or send mail to the list. 

emacs used to work fine.  but now it
won't start, and i didn't change anything in emacs.

the typical behavior people are encountering with this problem is that
they invoke emacs but either nothing happens or it produces an access
violation -- and yet they have changed nothing in their emacs
installation, and emacs used to work fine before this point.  most
likely, the problem is due to an interaction between emacs and some
new piece of software you have just installed (the most popular
culprit seems to be heapagent).  due to the nature in which emacs is
designed and built, emacs is fundamentally non-relocatable: it uses an
initialized heap segment that needs to be mapped in at a particular
virtual address at startup time before emacs will work correctly.  it
appears that programs like heapagent install dlls that intrude upon
emacs' virtual address space, preventing emacs to load its initialized
heap. 

if you have heapagent, then you can work around the problem in two
ways.  you can download the source and recompile, as described below.
or, you can use editbin to change the base address at which
the haloader.dll dll will be loaded (this is the dll that gets
loaded into every application's address space on startup): 


editbin /rebase:base=0x20000000 haloader.dll


otherwise, the only other workaround is to recompile emacs on your
machine so that emacs creates and initializes its heap at a virtual
address that does not conflict with software such as heapagent.  to do
this, you will need to download the source, #define the macro ntheap_probe_base
inside the procedure src\ntheap.c:allocate_heap(), and rebuild. 


why does emacs ask me to connect to my dialup service when it starts up?

for some users, when emacs starts up it pops up the dialog for
connecting to their dialup service, or sometimes appears to hang for a
few minutes and suddenly appear. 

the reason for this is that emacs now has networking support built in.
when emacs starts, the winsock dll automatically gets loaded and tries
to resolve the fully qualified domain name for your machine under the
name "localhost".  if the system doesn't have this name mapped, it
will try to query a nameserver on the internet, which is typically
some host within your isp and subsequently prompts to connect to your
dialup service so that it can ask a name server for the domain name of
your machine.  as you know, this is very unfortunate, and was not
anticipated when the networking support was added. 

this problem will be fixed when 19.32 comes out, but you can work
around the problem by giving the dialup support another method for
figuring out the domain name of your machine.  to do this, you need to
edit the hosts file for your system (located in %windir%\hosts on
win95 and %windir%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts on nt) so that localhost
becomes an alias for your machine name.  if your system doesn't have a
hosts file yet, you can easily create one by copying the sample hosts
file in the same directory, hosts.sam. 

for example, if my machine were named
banana-fish.cs.washington.edu, then i would edit the hosts
file from: 


127.0.0.1       localhost


to 


127.0.0.1       banana-fish.cs.washington.edu localhost


the hostname should be the value of invoking (system-name) in
the emacs *scratch* buffer, i.e., the fully qualified domain name for
your system.  note that you may also have to tell the system to look
in the hosts file as well as using dns. 

if this doesn't work for you, there are some other options (i have not
tried these): 



 turn off the auto-dial option of ppp under the control panel
dialup networking icon.  however, this would mean that you would have
to manually connect to your dialup service whenever you wanted to use
a network applicaton.  

 use a dummy winsock.dll.  cristian ionescu-idbohrn
&ltcii@kcs.se&gt has provided one called mozock.dll.  download the zip
file, unzip it, move the mozock.dll file to the bin directory where
emacs.exe resides, and then rename the mozock.dll file to wsock32.dll.
when emacs loads, it will load this wsock32.dll instead of the system
one.  

for networking support, you can use the external nttcp.exe program.  download
nttcp.exe and place it in your emacs bin directory.  also download
this version of tcp.el,
byte-compile it, and place it in your lisp directory.  then add the
following to your .emacs: 


  (load-library "tcp")
  (setq tcp-program-name "nttcp")


 edit the emacs.exe executable to remove the reference to
wsock32.dll in the import table.  copy emacs.exe to a backup file, and
then start up emacs (you might have to connect to your service
provider to do this), load emacs.exe into a buffer, search for
wsock32.dll, turn on overwrite mode, and then change wsock32.dll to
xsock32.dll by changing the 'w' to an 'x'.  now save the modified
emacs.exe.  now, to get networking support again, follow the
directions in the previous item. 

 delete all dns nameservers listed in the tcp/ip propoerties of
the network control panel dialog.  this is a rather drastic approach,
since you will want dns nameservers when running other applications
(and even the networking ones inside of emace). 




when i run emacs, a console window pops up.  how do i make it go away?

this is annoying, i know, and you shouldn't have to be dealing with
this.  but please bear with me for now.  if it isn't there already,
prepend "start" to the last line of the .bat file (the line that
invokes the emacs.exe executable).  then create a shortcut icon to the
emacs.bat file, and edit the properties of the shortcut (right
click on the icon).  on the program tab, select run: to
be minimized and make sure the close on exit checkbox is
checked.  double click on the icon, and emacs should start up cleanly.



how do i change the size, position, font, and
color attributes of emacs?

emacs can run in two different interface modes: the windows interface,
which allows the flexible use and mixture of fonts and colors; and the
console interface, which constrains emacs to the limitations of
console windows.  the following two sections describe how to specify
and change the size, position, font, and color attributes of emacs in
both interface modes.  


windows interface


with the windows interface, you can change the size, position, font,
and color attributes of emacs using three different mechanisms: using
the mouse with the user interface, by specifying them as command line
arguments, or by invoking emacs lisp functions.  you will probably
find it convenient to specify command line arguments in the
properties of the shortcut to the emacs batch file, and to
invoke the lisp functions in your startup file.  for information on
how to propagate attributes to new frames, see the section below on frames. 

size



user interface

to resize an emacs window, drag on a border with the mouse. 

command line

to have emacs start up with a particular size, invoke it with the
x windows -geometry command line argument.  for example, to
start emacs with a window 40 lines by 80 columns in size, use the
following: 


emacs -g 80x40


note that the geometry command can be combined with the position
command, as described below. 

emacs lisp

to change the size of an emacs frame using elisp, you can use the
two functions set-frame-width and set-frame-height.
for example, to resize emacs to display 40 lines by 80 columns, you could
use: 


(set-frame-height (selected-frame) 40)
(set-frame-width (selected-frame) 80)





position 


user interface

to reposition a running emacs, click on its title bar and drag the
window. 

command line

to start emacs at a particular position, invoke it with the x
windows -geometry command line argument.  for example, to start
emacs at pixel offset (10, 30) from the top left corner: 


emacs -g +10+30


to combine the size with position, first specify the size and then
the position.  the two examples above can be combined as follows: 


emacs -g 80x40+10+30


note that you can also specify position offsets from any of the
corners of the screen.  see the geometry
specifications section of the x man page for complete details on
the geometry command. 

emacs lisp

to reposition an emacs frame using elisp, you can use the
set-frame-position function.  for example, to move the
current frame to the offset (10, 30), you could use: 


(set-frame-position (selected-frame) 10 30)





fonts

fonts in emacs are named using the standard x windows format for
fonts.  these font names are the names that can be used as arguments
on the command line or in lisp functions.  to see the font name
corresponding to a font chosen using the font selection dialog,
execute the following elisp code in the *scratch* buffer: 


(insert (prin1-to-string (win32-select-font)))


to see the complete list of fonts that emacs has access to, execute
the following elisp code in the *scratch* buffer: 


(insert (prin1-to-string (x-list-fonts "*")))


for complete details on x windows font names, see the font names
section of the x man page. 

the font support currently is a little rough around the edges.  in
particular, italic fonts give emacs some problems; see below for more info about using italic
fonts.  generally it performs as expected, but occasionally you might
get unexpected results (e.g., emacs didn't quite use the font you told
it to use).  work is underway to fix these problems, but for now i
suggest experimenting if you encounter problems.  

also, x windows has the luxury of a set of font aliases (such as
fixed) that are convenient names for referring to specific
fonts.  work is underway to provide an equivalent alias mechanism
under win32 so that naming fonts does not have to be as cumbersome as
it currently is. 



user interface

to change the default font that emacs uses, shift click the left
mouse button (i.e., [shift-mouse-1]) and a font selection dialog will
pop up.  select the font that you would like to use, and click on the
ok button to close the dialog and use the selected font.  (note
that the dialog only displays fixed-pitch and screen fonts since emacs
cannot handle variable-pitched fonts.) 

command line

to start emacs with a particular font, use the the -font x
windows command line option.  for example, to start emacs with the
courier font of size 10 and font style regular,
invoke emacs using:


emacs -font "-*-courier-normal-r-*-*-13-97-*-*-c-*-*-ansi-"


emacs lisp

to change the default font of emacs using elisp, use the
set-default-font function: 


(set-default-font 
 "-*-courier-normal-r-*-*-13-97-*-*-c-*-*-ansi-")


to set the font of a particular face, use the set-face-font
function. 

registry

to change the default font of emacs frames using registry entries,
create a value in the key hkey_current_user\software\gnu\emacs: 


value name: emacs.font 
value type: reg_sz 
string: -*-courier-normal-r-*-*-13-97-*-*-c-*-*-ansi-


since the font strings are rather cumbersome, i would suggest cutting
the font string into the kill-ring (which will place it in the
clipboard, too) and pasting it (ctrl-v) into the regedit dialog.
(note that you shouldn't place quotes around the font string in the
registry.) 

if you have emacs frames with specific names, you can also specify a
font for that frame.  for the value name of the entry, use the
name of the frame instead of emacs (e.g., rmail.font
for your rmail frame). 




colors

as with other windowing attributes, emacs uses the x windows color
names for specifying colors on the command line and in elisp.  one set
of these names is a set of abstract color names, e.g., red,
green, and blue.  these names are the ones you will
typically use as arguments on the command line or in elisp functions.
emacs also supports the use of numeric color names; see the color names
section of the x man page for complete details on how to specify
numeric color names and their color spaces. 

to see the abstract color names that emacs understands and the colors
that they map to, use the menu command edit->text
properties->display colors, or invoke the
list-colors-display function in the *scratch* buffer: 


(list-colors-display)


if you would like to change the mapping of color names to rgb values,
or to add new color names to emacs, then you will want to modify the
alist win32-color-map.  to make changes, you can simply cons
new mappings onto the head of the alist: 


(setq win32-color-map (cons '("snow" . 16448255) win32-color-map))


the number in the element is the logical or of three values for the
red, green, and blue components: (b &lt&lt 16 | g &lt&lt 8 | r).  in
the example above, red is 255, green is 250, and blue is 250.  at some
point there will be support for reading in files with color mappings
to make this process a little easier. 



user interface

to change the foreground or background color in emacs through the
windowing interface, you can use the menu commands foreground
color->other and background color->other in
the edit->text properties menu. 

command line

to change the foreground or background color in emacs on
the command line, you can use the -fg and -bg
command line arguments.  for example, to start emacs with yellow
text on a black background, invoke emacs using: 


emacs -fg yellow -bg black


emacs lisp

you can use elisp functions to change the colors of any of the
emacs faces.  for example, to change the foreground or background
color of emacs, you can use the set-foreground-color and
set-background-color functions.  to change the color of an
arbitrary face, use the set-face-foreground and
set-face-background functions.  to change the color of the
cursor, use the set-cursor-color function.

the following elisp changes the background color to black: 


(set-background-color "black")


the following elisp changes the mode line foreground to firebrick: 


(set-face-foreground 'modeline "firebrick")


the following elisp changes the cursor color to purple: 


(set-cursor-color "purple")





frames

emacs uses two alists to determine the default appearances of frames,
default-frame-alist and initial-frame-alist.  the
default-frame-alist variable sets the basic defaults of all
frames.  since it is a common emacs usage to have the initial frame
have slightly different properties than other frames (e.g., its
position), you can use the initial-frame-alist variable to
override properties in default-frame-alist specially for the
initial frame.  you should definitely read the help text for these
variables (c-h v) for more details on the differences between the two
variables and how they interact with each other. 

below is an example of using default-frame-alist and
initial-frame-alist to configure the appearances of the
initial frame and all other frames (you would place this code in your
startup file).  with
default-frame-alist, we set the top left corner of new frames
to be at pixel offset +200+400, the width and height to be 80x40, the
cursor to be white, the foreground to be yellow, the background to be
black, and the font to be courier 10.  with
initial-frame-alist, we override the top left corner of the
initial frame to be at pixel offset +10+30, and inherit the remaining
properties for the initial frame from
default-frame-alist. 


(setq default-frame-alist
      '((top . 200) (left . 400)
	(width . 80) (height . 40)
	(cursor-color . "white")
	(foreground-color . "yellow")
	(background-color . "black")
	(font . "-*-courier-normal-r-*-*-13-97-*-*-c-*-*-ansi-")))

(setq initial-frame-alist '((top . 10) (left . 30)))



italics

emacs currently requires that italic versions of fonts have the same
width as the normal version of the font.  however, most of the default
fonts have italic and italic bold versions whose character widths are
larger than the normal version (the only default font that appears to
have viable italic and bold versions is courier new).  because of
this, emacs by default disables the use of italic faces. 

you can still enable the use of italic faces with emacs by setting the
variable win32-enable-italics to t in your startup
file:


(setq win32-enable-italics t)  ; this must be done before font settings!
(set-face-font 'italic "-*-courier new-normal-i-*-*-11-82-c-*-*-ansi-")
(set-face-font 'bold-italic "-*-courier new-bold-i-*-*-11-82-c-*-*-ansi-")


although this works best with courier new, there is still one minor
glitch: the italics versions are one pixel higher than the other
versions, so the line spacing is increased by a pixel when italics are
enabled. 


console interface


emacs can also run inside a console window.  simply invoke emacs with
the -nw command line option to do so.  although you cannot change the
size, font, or color of the window from within emacs, you can use the
window's menu to do so.  (if no icon has been created to invoke the
emacs batch file, then you'll have to create one to change these
attributes.) 

size

under nt, go to the upper left hand corner and open the "-" menu of
the console window.  select "screen size and position...", and use the
dialog to set the window to the size you want.  be sure to check the
"save window size and position" checkbox so that future invocations
will retain the new window size.  after closing the dialog box, resize
the window itself by dragging on the edges.

under win95, click on the properties icon in the icon
toolbar at the top of the window.  go to the "screen" tab and select
the desired window size in the "usage" panel.  click on "ok". 

position

to reposition emacs, click on the title bar of the console window
and drag it. 

font

under nt, open the "-" menu.  select "fonts...", and use
the dialog to set the window font to the one you want.  be sure to
check the "save configuration" checkbox so that your font change will
be used in future invocations.  click on "ok", and the window will get
resized. .

under win95, simply use the popup font menu in the upper
left-hand corner of the window.  or click on the font icon in the icon
toolbar.  or click on the properties icon in the icon toolbar and go
to the "font" tab and choose the font that you want to use. 

color

under the nt interface, open the "-" menu.  select "screen colors...",
and use the dialog to choose the colors you want to use for the
window.  be sure to check the "save configuration" checkbox so that
the colors are used in future invocations.  click on "ok".
unfortunately, the colors are not immediately used, but the changes
have been made.  to use the new colors, simply close the window and
use the icon to start emacs again.  emacs will then come up using the
colors you chose before. 

i'm not exactly sure how to change the colors on a per-console-window
basis under win95. 




where do i put my .emacs (or _emacs) file?

your startup file can be named either _emacs or .emacs, and should be
placed in your "home" directory.  if you have both files in your home
directory, emacs will load the .emacs file and ignore _emacs.  also,
if you have a version of emacs older than 19.31, emacs will only
recognized _emacs as the startup file. 

your home directory is where the home configuration variable tells
emacs it is.  as with the other emacs configuration variables, home
can be set in a number of ways:



environment variable: emacs will always first check to see
if you have an environment variable named home set and use that value
as your home directory.  under win95, you can set the home environment
variable in your autoexec.bat file; under nt, you can set the home
environment variable in the system panel of the control panel.  (note
that if you set home as an environment variable in the system panel it
will only take effect in new processes.)  

registry: if emacs doesn't find an environment variable
named home, it will check the registry for a value named home and use
that value as your home directory.  emacs first checks the key
"hkey_current_user\\software\\gnu\\emacs", and then the key
"hkey_local_machine\\software\\gnu\\emacs" (although the use of the
latter key is discouraged since home should be set on a per-user
basis, not on a per-machine basis).  note that the value of home is
not set by the addpm.exe program that initializes the registry
with the other emacs configuration variables. 



if emacs cannot find home set in any of the above locations, it will
assume your home directory is "c:\".  

the directory specified by home is also the directory substituted for
tildes (~) in file names (so, by definition, your startup file will be
in the directory "~\"). 


how do i swap capslock and control?

capslock and control cannot be swapped from within emacs, and windows
does not have a convenient mechanism like xmodmap to change virtual
key bindings.  instead, new keyboard layouts or device drivers need to
be installed to swap the two keys. 

warning: if you use a new keyboard layout
to switch capslock and control, beware of the option to use hotkey
sequences to switch keyboard layouts.  this option is in control
panel->keyboard under the language (win95) or input locales (nt) tabs;
the sequences themselves are "left alt+control" and "ctrl+shift".  if
you enable one of these options, then you will likely at some point
switch keyboard layouts while trying to use an emacs key
combination. 

nt 4.0:  for nt 4.0, check out swapcapslock.zip. 

nt 3.5, 3.51: james kittock has provided a program for nt that
installs a new keyboard layout with the two keys swapped.  once
installed, you can then select it using the "international" control
panel applet. 


readme
keyswap.tar


win95: microsoft has placed a keyboard remapping program for
win95 on their ftp site.  for more info, take a look at their kernel
toys page. 

mark russinovich has also written a freeware vxd that swaps capslock
and control under windows 95.  (i've been told that you might have to
hit the real control key once after installing the vxd to jumpstart
the mapping.)

subprocesses under emacs

emacs on nt and win95 can utilize subprocesses just like unix emacs.
however, the behavior of subprocesses with emacs may be unintuitive in
some situations.  this section discusses these situations, and how you
might work around them. 

programs reading input hang

programs that explicitly use a handle to the console ("con" or "con:")
instead of stdin and stdout cannot be used as subprocesses to emacs,
and they will also not work in shell-mode (the default ftp clients on
win95 and nt are examples of such programs).  there is no convenient
way for either emacs or any shell used in shell-mode to redirect the
input and output of such processes from the console to input and
output pipes.  the only workaround is to use a different
implementation of the program that does not use the console directly
(see the discussion on ange-ftp for a
replacement for the default ftp clients). 

buffering in shells

you may notice that some programs, when run in a shell in shell-mode,
have their output buffered (e.g., people have found this happening to
them with sql-mode).  when the program has a lot of output, it
overflows the buffering and gets printed to the shell buffer; however,
if the program only outputs a small amount of text, it will remain
buffered and won't appear in the shell buffer. 

although it may at first seem like the shell is buffering the output
from the program, it is actually the program that is buffering output.
the c runtime typically decides how to buffer output based upon
whether stdout is bound to a handle to a console window or not.  if
bound to a console window, output is buffered line by line; if bound
to a block device, such as a file, output is buffered block by block. 

in a shell buffer, stdout is a pipe handle and so is buffered in
blocks.  if you would like the buffering behavior of your program to
behave differently, the program itself is going to have to be changed;
you can use setbuf and setvbuf to manipulate the buffering semantics.


dos subprocesses

you can run dos subprocesses under emacs, but with the limitation that
you run only one at a time.  the implication of this is that, if you
use command.com under win95 as your shell, then you can only run one
shell process at a time (command.com is still a dos process even under
win95).  you can use other shells, such as bash, tcsh, or 4nt, instead
of command.com; see the section below on other
tools for pointers to other sites. 

andrew innes is working on removing this limitation.  if all goes
well, it should be available in 19.35. 


how do i use a shell in emacs?

you can use an interactive subshell in emacs by typing "m-x shell".
emacs uses the shell configuration variable to determine which program
to use as the shell.  if you installed emacs using the addpm.exe
program, then addpm.exe will associate the value %comspec% with shell
in the registry.  emacs will then use the value of the comspec
environment variable when it starts up, unless the shell
environment variable is explicitly defined (as when using the
emacs.bat batch file). 

if you would like to specify a different shell for emacs to use, then
you should do one of two things.  you should either explicitly set the
environment variable shell to be the shell you want to use, or, if you
want to have the comspec environment variable determine the shell,
then you need to install emacs using the addpm.exe program and ensure
that the shell environment variable is not defined when you
start up emacs. 

how do i prevent shell commands from being echoed?

some shells echo the commands that you send to them, and the echoed
commands appear in the output buffer.  in particular, the default
shells, command.com on win95 and cmd.exe on nt, have this
behavior. 

to prevent echoed commands from being printed, you can place the
following in your startup file: 


(setq comint-process-echoes t)


if shell-mode still is not stripping echoed commands, then you'll have
to explicitly tell the shell to not echo commands.  you can do this by
setting the explicit-shell-args variable
appropriately, where shell is the value of your shell
environment variable (do a "m-: (getenv "shell")" to see what it is
currently set to).  assuming that you are on nt and that your shell
environment variable is set to cmd.exe, then placing the following in
your startup file will tell cmd.exe to not echo commands: 


(setq explicit-cmd.exe-args '("/q"))


the comint package will use the value of this variable as an argument
to cmd.exe every time it starts up a new shell (as in shell-mode); the
/q is the argument to cmd.exe that stops the echoing (in a
shell, invoking "cmd /?" will show you all of the command line
arguments to cmd.exe).  

note that this variable is case sensitive; if the value of your shell
environment variable is cmd.exe instead, then this variable needs to
be named explicit-cmd.exe-args instead. 

why is a "specified command search directory bad" message printed?

the function shell in shell.el automatically invokes the
shell program with the argument "-i", and parses this as the directory
in which the shell program resides (which, of course, is invalid).  to
prevent this message from being printed, you can create a variable
named according to the form specified in the help message of
shell (to look at the help message, type "c-h f shell").  for
the default shells, then, you could place the following in your
startup file to prevent this message (these will eventually get into
winnt.el so you don't have to do this):


(setq explicit-command.com-args nil)
(setq explicit-command.com-args nil)
(setq explicit-cmd.exe-args nil)
(setq explicit-cmd.exe-args nil)


multiple lines for each shell are given since variable names are case
sensitive and shell names can be any case (so this only handles the
most common situations).  if you have an entirely different shell that
also complains about being given the "-i" switch, you can initialize a
similarly named variable to prevent the "-i" switch from being sent to
the shell. 

note that, if you would like to always pass arguments to an
interactive shell when it starts up, you would change the nil value in
the appropriate assignment above to the list of arguments you would
like to use with your shell.  for example, if you would like to invoke
command.com and tell it which directory its executable resides, you
could place something like the following in your startup file: 


;; determine the directory containing the shell program, explicitly making
;; certain that the directory separator is a backslash when doing so.
(let ((directory-sep-char ?\\))
  (setq shell-directory (file-name-directory (getenv "shell"))))

(setq explicit-command.com-args (list shell-directory))
(setq explicit-command.com-args (list shell-directory))


when i run programs within a shell i get
"incorrect dos version" messages.  why?

this might happen if, for example, you invoke nmake in a shell and it
tries to create subshells.  the problem is related to the one above
where, again, when the shell is initially created, the first argument
to the shell is not the directory in which the shell program resides.
when this happens, command.com fabricates a value for its comspec
environment variable that is incorrect.  then, when other programs go
to use comspec to find the shell, they are given the wrong value. 

the fix for this is to either prevent any arguments from being sent to
the shell when it starts up (in which case command.com will use a
default, and correct, value for comspec), or to have the first
argument be the directory in which the shell executable resides.
examples of how to do both of these are in shown in the previous subsection. 


how do i use mail with emacs?

you do not need to do much to use mail with emacs under win32, but you
do need to be able to communicate with local mail daemons and mail
servers (they do most of the work) to both receive and send mail from
your system.  these daemons and servers are typically running on the
machines in your local network that are already handling mail for you
and/or other users on other systems. 

i've only tested the outgoing and incoming rmail setups.  if you find
that the suggested code for any of the other incoming mail
configurations is inaccurate, please let me know. 

outgoing

for outgoing mail, you need an elisp file, smtpmail.el, that enables emacs
to talk smtp with mail daemons (smtpmail.el was written by tomoji
kagatani &ltkagatani@rbc.ncl.omron.co.jp&gt and has been submitted to
be included in future distributions).  you also need to add the
following to your startup file (be sure to customize for you and your
system): 


(setq user-full-name "your full name")
(setq user-mail-address "your email address")

(setq smtpmail-default-smtp-server "domain name of machine with smtp server")
(setq smtpmail-local-domain nil)
(setq send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)

(load-library "smtpmail")


incoming: rmail and pop3

for incoming mail using the rmail package and a pop3 mail server, you
need only place the following in your startup file (again, be sure to
customize): 


(setenv "mailhost" "domain name of machine with pop3 server")
(setq rmail-primary-inbox-list '("po:your login") rmail-pop-password-required t)


note that you will need to customize the domain name of machine
with pop3 server and your login fields to be the name of
your pop server and your login name. 

incoming: vm and pop3

for incoming mail using the vm package and a pop3 mail server, you
first need the vm package (check any elisp archive) and then you need
to place the following in your .vm configuration file: 


(setq vm-spool-files 
      (list 
       (list "~/inbox"
             "pop3 server:110:pass:pop user name:*"
             "~/inbox.crash")))


note that you will need to customize the pop3 server and pop
user name fields to be your login name and the name of your pop
server.  you will also probably want to customize the name of your
inbox and crash files (~/inbox and ~/inbox.crash in
the example above.) 

incoming: gnus

you should be able to use gnus 5.2 and above as a mail reader.  the
following was sent as an example by marc fleischeuers
&ltmarc.fleischeuers@kub.nl&gt:


;; for sending mail
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it)

;; for reading mail (other backends can be substituted for nnml)
(setq gnus-secondary-select-methods '((nnml "")))
(setq nnmail-spool-file "po:pop user name")
(setq nnmail-pop-password-required t)


be sure to customize the pop user name field appropriately. 

tm

i don't know of any complete ports of tm to the win32 environment, but
fabrice popineau &ltpopineau@esemetz.ese-metz.fr&gt has made some
modifications to the os2 version of tm.  see his description of what he has
done for more info.  the support programs mentioned can be found in mm.zip (note that they have only
been tested on nt 4.0, though). 


how do i use ange-ftp with emacs?

you will need some additional files before ange-ftp will work with
emacs.  partly this is due to the unfortunate fact that the ftp
program shipped with win95 and nt does not accept a password from a
pipe or a redirected file, and partly this is due to some
incompatibilities in the ange-ftp.el lisp file when used on
windows. 

chris szurgot &ltszurgot@itribe.net&gt has been working on both of
these problems.  he has a version of ftp that solves the password
problem, and a version of ange-ftp that deals with the
incompatibilities.  you can find both on his ftp server: 


ftp://ftp.itribe.net/pub/virtunix/ftp.zip
http://www.itribe.net/virtunix/files/emacs/ange-ftp.el



place the ftp.exe executable in a directory where you keep your local
executables, and the ange-ftp.el file in whatever directory you keep
custom and personalized elisp files (you will probably also want to
byte-compile ange-ftp.el, too).  then be sure that the exec-path
variable is set so that, when emacs runs the ftp.exe program, it runs
the one you downloaded (and not the default one).  likewise, be sure
to set load-path so that, when ange-ftp is invoked, the ange-ftp.el
file you downloaded gets loaded instead of the default one.  as an
example, assuming that you placed ftp.exe in, say, %home%\bin and
ange-ftp.el in %home%\elisp, you could set exec-path and load-path as
follows in your startup file: 


(setq exec-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/bin") exec-path))
(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/elisp") load-path))


as another alternative, you can tell ange-ftp exactly which ftp
program to use by customizing ange-ftp-ftp-program-name, e.g.: 


(setq ange-ftp-ftp-program-name "c:/bin/ftp.exe")


with this method you don't have to worry about the wrong ftp program
being picked up through exec-path. 

you will also want to customize the temporary directory that ange-ftp
uses to cache files: 


(setq ange-ftp-tmp-name-template 
      (concat (expand-file-name (getenv "temp")) "/ange-ftp"))
(setq ange-ftp-gateway-tmp-name-template 
      (concat (expand-file-name (getenv "temp")) "/ange-ftp"))


note that this particular ftp client was ported pretty much only for
use with emacs; if you're looking for a snazzier ftp client for more
general use, you might want to look at the ncftp client on chris's ftp
server. 


how do i use telnet with emacs?

as far as i know, there is no telnet client that you can successfully
use as a subprocess to emacs, and so telnet mode does not work.  most
telnet clients for windows are gui apps that use their own windows;
emacs requires a console app that works with pipes.  

to get telnet working with emacs, i see two possibilities.  one is to
implement a version of telnet.el that talks the telnet protocol
directly (c.f. the gnus implementation), skipping the telnet program
altogether.  the other possibility is to implement a console version
of telnet.  chris szurgot &ltszurgot@itribe.net&gt has a console app
telnet on his ftp server (see ftp://ftp.itribe.net/pub/virtunix/telc10a.zip),
but it unfortunately uses direct console input and output.  this
version can be hacked to use stdin and stdout, and then could be used
as an emacs subprocess. 


how do i use crypt with emacs?

the crypt++ package doesn't yet work out of the box with emacs on
win32.  david s. rosinger &ltdsrosing@fed3005.reston.ingr.com&gt modified
crypt++.el so that it would work, commenting: 

 this package will allow you to transparently visit `.z',
`.gz', `.tar', `.tar.gz' and dos files.  (however, on occasion,
certain `.tar.gz' files lock up emacs...don't know why, but killing
`gzip' frees up emacs again.)  

download this version of crypt++.el and place it
somewhere in your load path.  you'll also need the
compression/uncompression utilities (look in ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/utilities)
in your exec path. 


how do i use the browse-url package?

caleb deupree  has put together a package
for intergrating browse-url.el with emacs on win32.  first pick up the
latest browse-url.el from http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/emacs/browse-url.el
(note that this is a much more recent version than is shipped with
emacs), and set it up as per the instructions in that file.  then
download and install the shelex.exe program, making sure
that it is in your exec-path. (the code for shelex.exe is in shelex.c.)

then add the following commands to your startup file: 


(defvar shell-execute-helper "shelex.exe")
(defun shell-execute-url (url &optional new-window)
"invoke the shell-execute-helper program to call shellexecute and launch
or re-direct a web browser on the specified url."
   (interactive "surl: ")
   (call-process shell-execute-helper nil nil nil url))

(setq browse-url-browser-function 'shell-execute-url)
(setq gnus-button-url 'shell-execute-url)		; gnus
(setq vm-url-browser 'shell-execute-url)		; vm


this works with the default browser on your system, whether it's ie or
something else.  however, you must have ie3 installed on your system
for it to work with other browsers as the dll that makes this all
work, wininet.dll, only gets installed when ie3 is installed. 


how do i use emacs with a two-button mouse?

emacs assumes that you have a three-button mouse by default.  however,
if you have a two-button mouse, you can press both buttons at once to
emulate the missing middle button expected by emacs.  if you have a
three-button mouse, but the middle mouse button does not work for you,
skip to the end of this section.  

three variables control mouse button emulation under emacs:
win32-num-mouse-buttons,
win32-mouse-button-tolerance, and
win32-swap-mouse-buttons.  if you use help on
win32-num-mouse-buttons (i.e., with "c-h v"), it will tell
you how many buttons emacs thinks your mouse has; if
win32-num-mouse-buttons is less than 3, then emacs will
emulate the middle mouse button.  

emacs emulates the middle mouse button by treating simultaneous button
presses of the left and right buttons as a middle button press.  since
presses both buttons cannot really be simultaneous, emacs compares
button presses within a specified window of time to determine whether
it should emulate the middle button.  this window of time is
controlled using win32-mouse-button-tolerance.  help on this
variable will show you the value emacs uses by default, and you can
change this value to suit your needs. 

depending upon the type of two-button mouse, you may find it useful to
swap the mapping of middle and right mouse buttons.  by default, the
middle button is mapped to mouse-2 and the right button is
mapped to mouse-3.  if you set
win32-swap-mouse-buttons to a non-nil value, then you can
swap these two mappings. 

some people find that they have a three button mouse, but the middle
mouse button does not work for them.  first check to see if
win32-num-mouse-buttons is set correctly.  if so, then check
to see whether your mouse has been installed with the proper driver
(open control panel->mouse to examine the driver being used).  if
nothing seems to be amiss, then at the very least you can have emacs
emulate the middle button by setting win32-num-mouse-buttons
to 2. 



how do i highlight the region between the point and the mark?

to highlight the region between the point and the mark, use the
function transient-mark-mode:


(transient-mark-mode t)



how do i change the sound of the emacs beep?

you can use the function set-message-beep to change the sound
that emacs uses for its beep.  emacs allows you to specify one of the
windows system sounds for the beep.  for example, to use the
ok system sound, place the following in your startup file:



(set-message-beep 'ok)


look up help for the function for a complete description of how to use
the function and which sounds it recognizes. 


how do i display iso 8859 characters?

to display iso 8859 characters, place the following in your
startup file: 


(standard-display-european t)


to input 8-bit characters, you may also need to adjust the input mode
(from johan myreen (jem@vistacom.fi)): 



(set-input-mode (car (current-input-mode))
                (nth 1 (current-input-mode))
                0)




how do i print from emacs?

pascal obry has a nice
example of how to set up some variables to get printing to work on
nt. 

jeff paquette &ltpaquette@ici.net&gt has a version of pr
for use with emacs, and instructions on how to set it up. 

vassil peytchev &ltvassil@msn.fullfeed.com&gt has an example of how to use
ghostscript to print to non-postscript printers. 


is there a package for editing windows specific files (.bat, .ini, .inf, etc.)?

peter breton &ltpbreton@i-kinetics.com&gt has written a package called
generic-mode for editing windows specific files (such as .bat, .ini,
.inf, .reg, .rc, and .rul files).  download generic-mode.el and generic-extras.el, place
them somewhere in your load-path, byte-compile them, and then follow
the instructions at the top of file to use them. 


how do i associate files with emacs?

you can use a package like gnuserv to associate files with emacs so
that opening a file outside of emacs (e.g., by double-clicking on its
icon) will create a new frame in a running emacs displaying that file.
peter breton &ltpbreton@dirac.i-kinetics.com&gt ported a version of
gnuserv to nt that used named pipes.  since win95 doesn't support
named pipes, nico francois &ltnico.francois@scala.nl&gt modified it
again to use mailslots so that it would work on both platforms. 

nico's distribution is in: 


gnuserv.zip (updated 10/10/96)
readme.nt


note that you can set up file associations in win95/nt 4.0 using
explorer by selecting the "view->options..." menu operation, and then
clicking on the "file types" tab in the dialog that pops up.  clicking
on a file type will allow you to edit it and associate the file with
gnuclient.exe. 

comments from nico:


i've made some small modifications and now there's a gnuclientw.exe
included which is compiled as a windows program (it will also force
the -q flag on so it doesn't hang around for nothing). 

ideal to be used for file associations.  also rather cool to put a
shortcut to gnuclientw.exe on your desktop and have the ability to
drag-n-drop files into emacs. 



how do i access unix files via nfs?

if you mount unix file systems onto your machine (e.g., with samba),
and you would like to prevent your files from being translated to the
dos cr/lf format, you can use using-unix-filesystems by
placing the following: 


(using-unix-filesystems t)


in your startup file.  note, though, that this has emacs treat all files as if
they were on a unix filesystem, which can be very limiting.  

a future replacement for using-unix-filesystems are the
functions at the end of untranslate.el.  these
functions enable you to turn on and off translation on an individual
filesystem basis.  if you want to use these functions, download and
place untranslate.el in your load-path and have it loaded from your
startup file.  then you can place calls to
add-untranslated-filesystem to selectively access filesystems
in binary mode. 


is there a mode for editing visual basic source?

fred white &ltfwhite@world.std.com&gt has written a package for
editing visual basic source.  download basic-mode.el, place it in
your load-path, and follow the directions at the top of the file to
use it.  fred's comments: 


here is a simple mode for editing programs written in the world's most
sucessful programming language.  it features indentation, font
locking, keyword capitalization, and some other convenience functions.



is there a version of rcs for win32?

you can find a collection of the rcs x86 executables in rcs57nt.zip.  i was told mark
alexander &ltmarka@daddy.pepper.com&gt did the port. 

(executables provided by peter breton
&ltpbreton@dirac.i-kinetics.com&gt.  i don't have any source.) 

note that to use rcs you will also need a copy of gnu
diff.  


is there a version of ispell for win32?

henry thorpe has &ltthorpe@iew.sed.monmouth.army.mil&gt has ported a
somewhat hacked up version of ispell to win32.  you can get it from
his ftp server at ftp://www.sesd.ilex.com/pub/thorpe/nt-ispell.cygnus.hacked.zip. 

brian tibbetts &lttibbetts@cat.rpi.edu&gt has also done some work on
making ispell more win32 friendly.  check out his page at http://cat.rpi.edu/~tibbetts/ispell_toc.html
(his latest update on 10/16/96). 


does emacs support popup menus?

the standard distribution does not yet support popup menus like the
unix version does.  mark jungerman &ltmjungerm@us.oracle.com&gt and
&lthsexton@us.oracle.com&gt (my apologies; i seem to have lost your
name!) have implemented popup menu support, although its programming
semantics are slightly different than the standard emacs popup menu
semantics (jake colman &ltjcolman@jnc.com&gt is trying to remedy this
situation).  if you would like to use what they have implemented, you
can download their patches
(which were made to the 19.34.1 source). 


bugs

below is a list of the most obvious bugs that users typically
encounter.  i am aware that these bugs exist, so there is no need to
send a bug report to either me or to the mailing list.  if i know of a
workaround, i'll mention it along with the description of the bug. 

in time i will grow this list to be a more comprehensive
list of bugs.  

19.34



ange-ftp: ange-ftp and unc
file names cause confusion; names of the form /server:/top are being
expanded to /server:c:/top. 

untranslate: inserting a
file into a buffer changes the buffer type to the type of the inserted
file. 

x color names: x color
names of the forms #rrrgggbbb, rgb:rrr/ggg/bbb, rgbi:rrr/ggg/bbb,
etc., are not parsed and converted to windows colors. 

faces and new frames:
some face definitions are not used when a new frame is created. 

{[]}\ with alt-gr:
these keys are not handled correctly on some keyboard layouts. 



as of 19.30.1



the keys delete, m-del and m-backspace don't work as expected.  to
fix this, put the following in your startup file: 


(global-set-key [delete] "\c-d")
(global-set-key [m-delete] "\m-d")
(global-set-key [m-backspace] [?\m-\177])


autosave files become the same file as the original file (e.g.,
foo.bat and foo.bat~ refer to the same file).  this problem is
actually a bug in windows 95 (you can use the dos move command to
reproduce the bug).  you can workaround this bug by placing the
following in your startup file: 


(setq backup-by-copying t)


(note that this workaround only works for autosave files, though.) 

pop-up menus aren't implemented. 

the control and meta keys can get stuck such that emacs thinks
they are being pressed when they are not.  a workaround is to toggle
the keys a couple of times to get emacs back on track. 

rcs menu commands are greyed out when they seemingly shouldn't be. 

emacs gets a fatal error when loading vm-folder while starting up
the vm package. 

emacs doesn't load the startup file (_emacs) even though home is
set correctly.  (i can't reproduce this; if this is happening to
someone who can also debug emacs, i would appreciate your trying to
track down what is going on.)  a workaround is to invoke emacs with
the "-l %home%\_emacs" command line argument.  

ange-ftp doesn't work because of the colons.  no workaround.
(fixed in 19.31.)

bookmarks from the menu don't seem to work. 

capslock acts like a shift key. 

the desktop library doesn't work (delimiter problem). 

the paste menu item doesn't correspond to the clipboard (yank
does, though). 

getting file-attributes on locked files doesn't work. 

emacs loses keyboard input after it has been iconified.  a
workaround for this is to maximize the window and then return it to
its normal size. 

scrollbars aren't supported.  (no workaround.) 

"emacs -nw" doesn't work.  to have emacs run in a console window,
it has to be compiled to do so.  (fixed in 19.31, but still doesn't
work inside a telnet window.)

emacsclient and server are not supported. 

keyboard macros with search (c-s) don't always work. 

setting debug-on-error to t crashes emacs. 




i get these strange error messages.  what's wrong?


m-x shell, etc., fails with 'invalid read syntax: "."'
m-x shell, etc., fails with 'symbol's value as variable is void: ll\.'

these error messages appear when a precompiled source distribution
has been unpacked incorrectly.  see the note to unpacking the distributions above
on the source of this problem and how to solve it.

symbol's value as variable is void: pressions\.

this error message appears during the dumping phase when
compiling a source distribution that has been unpacked
incorrectly. see the note to unpacking the
distributions above on the source of this problem and how to solve
it.

c-z produces can't spawn ...

when emacs suspends, it actually creates and runs a new shell.  it
uses the shell environment variable to determine which shell to run.
if this environment variable is set incorrectly, the above error
message will appear.  change your shell environment variable to be a
valid shell to solve this problem. 




win95 specific problems

i get these "out of environment space" messages.  why?

the emacs.bat script sets a number of environment variables that are
used by emacs to function properly.  the console process in which the
script is executed runs out of memory in which to set these
environment variables, causing a mess of problems.  

to get around this problem, create a shortcut icon to the emacs.bat
script.  then right click on the icon and select properties.  in the
dialog box that pops up, select the memory tab and then change the
environment memory allocation from auto to 1024.  close
the dialog box and then double click on the icon to start emacs. 

the esc key doesn't seem to work on win95.  why?

on early beta versions of win95, esc key events were not propagated to
emacs.  if you are still using an early beta version, then you will
have to upgrade your version of win95 to solve this problem. 

emacs doesn't refresh correctly.  why?

even with the official release of win95, there seems to be a bug that
confuses emacs when it refreshes the screen under certain
circumstances.  a workaround is being implemented in the next
version. 

when will the win95 version have
subprocess support?

due to legal technicalities of contributed work, subprocess support
will arrive shortly after 19.31 has been officially released through
the fsf.  (andrew innes is contributing this code, as well as many
other bug fixes.  all kudos to andrew.) 


patches

below are sets of patches that fix specific bugs, and are organized by
release.  they are only useful if you have the source to emacs.  (note
also that they do not represent the set of differences between one
major release and the next; they are typically patches to popular
problems, or patches that i've sent to the list.) 


19.30.0
	
	enable emacs to be compiled with vc 4.0
	emulate getuid and geteuid.
	fix menu update problem.
	
19.30.1
	
	makes truetype
and italic fonts usable.
	only update
the menu when absolutely necessary.
	an elisp file with
palette rgb values for colors.
	



what other unix tools have been ported to nt and/or windows 95?

probably the first place you should look for more gnu tools is at
cygnus in the gnu-win32 project, which is not only trying to port the
gnu tools to win32, but also provide libraries that allow unix
programs to use win32 without modification.  the project is at http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32. 
 
an older set of the gnu tools that i have seen offered on ftp sites
for nt and win95 have been based on the congruent tools (i have heard
mixed reviews of these ports, so use with your own discretion).  an
ftp site that seems to offer the full set of these tools is ftp.cc.utexas.edu/microlib/nt/gnu. 

microsoft also has a collection of tools for use with nt, including
unix tools such as cron, ps, kill, and nice, as well as a number of nt
specific tools.  a list of these tools is at http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/tools/maintnce.htm. 

if you're a perl user, then you probably want the port of perl to
win32.  check out hip
communication's port of perl 5 for win32. 

david wihl is maintaining a faq about porting unix applications to nt.
it can be found at http://www.shore.net/~wihl/unix2nt.html. 

chris szurgot is also collecting and implementing unix style tools for
windows 95 (and presumably nt).  see http://www.itribe.net/virtunix. 

jeff paquette &ltpaquette@ici.net&gt has a collection of the gnu text
utilities for win32.  see http://www.tiac.net/users/paquette/winprogramming.html. 



what's the name of the nt emacs mailing list?

the name of the nt emacs mailing list is
ntemacs-users@cs.washington.edu.  it's a majordomo administered
list, so, if you would like to subscribe to the mailing list, send a
message to ntemacs-users-request@cs.washington.edu
with the word "subscribe" in the body of the message. 

to unsubscribe from the list, send a message to ntemacs-users-request@cs.washington.edu
with the word "unsubscribe" in the body of the
message. please do not send the unsubscribe message to the list
itself, but to the request alias instead.  sending the message to the
list does not unsubscribe you from it, and it tends to be annoying to
people on the list. 

if you are trying to unsubscribe from the list but are encountering
problems, send me mail directly and i will manually remove you from
the list.  again, do not send mail to the list complaining that you
cannot unsubscribe from it.  

from the list's "info" message:



the list ntemacs-users@cs.washington.edu is a forum for discussion
related to using gnu emacs on windows nt and windows 95.  please feel
free to ask and/or answer any questions related to emacs on nt or
win95 as you see fit, although i ask that questions regarding general
use of emacs be directed to the emacs info files and the general emacs
news groups, such as comp.emacs and gnu.emacs.help.

i will also be sending announcements about new releases and bug fixes
to this list.  these announcements should be relatively infrequent,
however.



where are the archives for ntemacs-users?

the ntemacs-users list is being archived in hypermail.  the gaps
between archived directories are due to mail being thrown away by
hypermail.

my interest in mobile computing stems from ongoing research at rutgers
university, where i was an undergraduate.  at the university of
washington i am part of a group working in the area.  i am interested
in the systems aspects of mobile computing and hope to stumble over
academic research in this area by immersing myself into a mobile
environment.  



for our research we initially worked with the hardware and software
infrastructure built around the xerox palo alto research center's
(parc) ``ubiquitous computing project.''  the hardware includes
low-power, infrared transceivers and handheld pen-based tablets. the software
includes an application suite and service infrastructure that allows the handheld devices to
operate with stationary applications.



our current research is described in the uw
mobile computing home page. this fall terri watson will be
joining our research group, who has been working on wit.



marc's immediate project is to write a device driver for the proxim
rangelan2 wireless ethernet card.  this work is part of his mobile
computing independent project.

 

marc is also interested in pcmcia devices and how they tie into mobile
computing:



flash memory devices.

smart cards of the future.

 abstract  

ironman is a novel communication interface that enables portable
compilers for parallel languages to exploit machine primitives for
improved performance.  even hardware vendor supplied portable message
passing interfaces such as mpi and pvm are not sufficient because
their rigid interfaces often preclude the ability to exploit
machine-specific features and employ machine independent
optimizations.  ironman eliminates the overhead of portability by
identifying the minimal, basic characteristics of communication on any
machine and abstracting them into the interface, thereby facilitating
platform-specific mappings of these abstractions that are best suited
to the machine and even the application.  we introduce the ironman
interface, its use, and its implementation.  we demonstrate ironman's
ability to remain portable while delivering good performance for
benchmarks on the intel paragon and the cray t3d.

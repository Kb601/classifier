zpl overview




 zpl overview



zpl is a new array programming language designed for engineering and
scientific programs that would previously have been written in fortran.
because its design goals were machine independence and high performance, zpl
programs run fast on both sequential and parallel computers.  because it is
"implicitly parallel," i.e. the programmer does not express the parallelism,
zpl programs are simple and easy to write.

on this page, zpl is described at a high level by answering the "obvious"
questions about it and its implementation. the page concludes with a zpl fact
sheet.



what is an array language? in scalar languages like fortran, c,
pascal and ada, operations apply only to single values, so a + b expresses
the addition of two numbers.  in such languages adding two arrays requires
indexing and looping:


   do 10 i = 1, n                     for ( i=0; i&ltn; i++) {
      do 10 j = 1, n		          for ( j=0; j&ltn; j++){
10       a(i,j) = a(i,j) + b(i,j)             a[i][j] = a[i][j]+b[i][j];
                                          }
                                      }
            fortran 77                               c


this need to loop and index to perform operations on arrays is both
tedious and error prone.

in zpl operations are generalized to apply to both scalars and arrays.
thus, a + b expresses the sum of two scalars if a and b were declared as
scalars, or arrays if they were declared as arrays.  when applied to arrays,
the operations act on corresponding elements as illustrated in the loops
above.  indeed, when the zpl compiler encounters the statement


	a := a + b;


and a and b are two dimensional arrays, it generates code that is effectively
the same as the c loops shown above.  an array language, therefore,
simplifies programming.

why create a new array language? programming languages are created
all the time in computer science, but the widespread adoption of a new
programming language is an extremely rare event.  the recent use of
object-oriented languages shows that it does occur from time-to-time.
nevertheless, the cardinal rule is, "if you want your research to be applied
in practice, do not invent a new language."  it is much better to extend or
enhance an existing language that has an established user base.

parallelism, in the opinion of zpl's designers, is a phenomenon that
cannot be fully exploited through the medium of existing programming
languages, even existing array languages, such as fortran 90 and apl
[greenlaw90].  case after case demonstrates that effective parallel
computations are typically accomplished through a "paradigm shift" away from
sequential solutions.  this shift, which is more frequently discontinuous
than the term "shift" implies, is inhibited by languages designed for
sequential computers.

a new language can avoid these problems and facilitate the paradigm
shift.  further, by choosing its primitives carefully, new research in
parallel compilation can apply.  so, zpl has been designed from first
principles (see below) to realize these goals.

isn't programming with arrays hard? programmers unfamiliar with
them may find array languages a little different initially, but technical
programmers, meaning scientists, engineers, mathematicians, statisticians,
etc., will generally find them natural.  indeed, many science and engineering
problems are formulated in a way that is perhaps closer to array languages
than scalar languages.

as a trivial example, consider the computation of the mean and standard
deviation of a sample of n items.  the
textbook definitions of these quantities are: 





in zpl, mu and sigma are computed by
single statements which mirror the definitions:


    mu    := +&lt;&lt;sample/n;                   -- mean

    sigma := sqrt((+&lt;&lt;sqr(sample-mu))/n);   -- std deviation


the array sample contains the items, and the operator
+&lt;&lt; sums them.  so m is a direct translation.  the computation
is analogous and illustrates several features of zpl, including subtracting
mu from each item of sample, (this is called
promoting a scalar to an array), promoting a scalar function sqr to be
an array function by applying it to each item of the array, etc.  these
properties of zpl, e.g. promotion, are simply programming language
terminology for natural concepts technically educated people already know.


after using zpl for a few months, a graduate student research assistant in
civil engineering rebelled when told to program in c again.

high performance is widely claimed; why believe it for zpl? for
some languages "high performance" is part of the name.  for zpl, "high
performance" is part of the description, as backed by experimental evidence
[dikaiakos,lewis,lin95.]
this evidence takes different forms, but is always relative to other means of
achieving good performance.  for example, fortran 77 programs run
sequentially, or c programs customized to a parallel platforms (with user
specified communication), are regarded as reasonable ways to establish good
baselines, since these usually represent the best alternatives to achieving
good performance.

the evidence of zpl's high performance derives from several types of
experiments [lin94, lin95], one of which will be mentioned here:  simple is a
fluid dynamics program developed at lawrence livermore national laboratories
to benchmark new computers and compilers.  the computation has been widely
used in the study of parallel computing.  a parallel version of the original
2400 line fortran 77 program was developed by gannon and panetta [gannon86].
a high quality, variable grain version written in c requires approximately
5000 lines [lee92].  this c program, customized to the intel paragon and the
kendal square research ksr-2, was compared to the 520 line zpl program for
simple [lin94].  the speedups of these programs are shown for experiments
involving 10 iterations on a 256 x 256 size problem.


 


the experiments indicate that the high level zpl performs as well as the
low-level c program for these two machines.  other information suggests that
similar behavior can be expected on any mimd parallel computer [lin90].

why does zpl have such good performance? zpl does not have parallel
"directives" or other forms of explicit parallelism.  instead, it exploits
the fact that when programmers describe computations in terms of arrays, many
scalar operations must be performed to implement the array operations. this
"implied" computation can be parceled out to different processors to get
concurrency.  thus, the parallelism comes simply from the semantics of the
array operations.

what does 'zpl was designed from first principles' mean? zpl is
actually the dataparallel sublanguage of a more powerful parallel programming
language, called advanced zpl [lin94] or a-zpl.  a-zpl is a fully general
parallel language for "power" users, i.e. programmers with extreme
performance requirements and the sophistication to use more demanding
technology.  a-zpl is not yet implemented, and its completion is not expected
for at least two years.

advanced zpl (known previously as orca c) implements a programming model,
called phase abstractions [griswold90].  the phase abstractions model is
capable of expressing task parallelism, pipelined parallelism and other
parallel programming paradigms, not just data parallelism.  the phase
abstractions programming model is built on and generalizes a parallel machine
model, called the cta [snyder86].  the cta abstracts the family of
multiple-instruction-multiple-data (mimd) computers.  the two models are the
mechanism by which the benefits and costs of parallel computation are
succinctly conveyed to a-zpl programmers [snyder93].  the models balance the
conflicting requirements that to write efficient code, the programmer needs
to make decisions based on how the program will be executed, but to be
machine independent (portable) the programmer must avoid reliance on any
particular machine facilities.  the relationships of this approach to others
have been described [snyder95], and feasibility studies indicate that the
approach works [lin92].

the phase abstractions programming model recognizes three different
"programming levels":


process or "x" level -- a composition of instructions,
phase or "y" level -- a composition of processes into a parallel 
                        algorithm,
problem or "z" level -- a composition of phases to solve the overall 
                          application.


the letter name of this highest, problem solving programming level
motivates the language's name.

learning the language.  a simple introduction of some of the basic
zpl concepts is available online as a walk-through of a zpl program.  a tutorial
introduction to programming in zpl is available as the zpl programmer's
guide.  the zpl language manual defines the language specifics.  sample
programs and scientific research papers are also available.

writing your first program.  perhaps the simplest way to write and
run a zpl program on your unix machine is to use the web compiler.  you paste a zpl program (your own or
one of ours) into a window, and click "compile." the program is packaged up
and sent to a machine at the uw cse department.  it is compiled into ansi c
and returned to you.  a "make" of this file will result in an executable that
can be run on your sequential computer.

parallel use of zpl.  to run on a parallel computer zpl must first
be targeted to that parallel computer.  this is an operation that is
typically not performed by zpl applications programmers, but is
straightforward for parallel computer systems administrators.  the present
platforms on which zpl runs are


intel paragon
cray research t3d
kendal square research ksr-2
pvm running on a scientific workstation
sequential unix platforms.

once zpl has been targeted to your type of parallel computer and the
libraries installed at your facility, you are ready to use zpl in parallel.
it is not necessary to install the zpl compiler on your workstation, because
for the near term all zpl compilation will be performed at the university of
washington.  this is to assist in rapidly disseminating compiler improvements
to the user community.  (you can't have a stale version of the compiler!)
however, we provide some software that you will want to install on your
workstation which will simplify this remote compilation, and give you the
convenience similar to compiling locally.

zpl fact sheet

name.  zpl is short for the z (level) programming language; see
discussion of programming model, above.

origin.  zpl was designed and implemented by the orca project of
the computer science and engineering department at the university of
washington.

type.  zpl uses the array abstraction to implement a dataparallel
programming model; it is a standalone subset of advanced zpl.

history.  implementation of the zpl compiler began in march 1993.
it generated code approximately 15 months later.  zpl will be officially
"released" during the fourth quarter, 1995.

approach.  zpl is translated into a conventional abstract syntax
tree representation on which program analysis and optimizations are
performed.  ansi c code is generated as the object code.  this c program is
machine independent, and implements certain operations in abstract form.
this code is compiled using the native c compiler on the target machine with
custom libraries.  in this second compilation the abstract operations are
customized to the specific platform.  

team.  the creators of zpl are: brad chamberlain, sung-eun choi,
marios dikaiakos, george forman, e christopher lewis, calvin lin, larry
snyder, and w. derrick weathersby with assistance from ruth anderson and kurt
partridge.

funding.  the foundational research for the zpl compiler was funded
in part by the office of naval research n00014-89-j-1368.  the compiler
itself was funded in part by the advanced research projects agency,
n00014-92-j-1824.

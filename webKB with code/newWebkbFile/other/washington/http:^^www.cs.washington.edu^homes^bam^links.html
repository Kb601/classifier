bam's glorified hotlist 




 links 

   i have an odd collection of links.  i don't necessarily agree with
what's in them, and i haven't even looked at many of them yet.  some are
cheesy, some are esoteric, and a lot aren't quite what i wanted. but
they're all links that interested me, and links that i wanted to be able
to recall easily so i could (re)explore them.  my page, like anything else
on the web, is mostly a glorified hotlist. 

   clicking on a picture on this page or the pages beneath it will
take you to the site i stole the picture from.  don't forget to look
at my personal page to see links to the
things i'm most interested in.

   and away we go...

smells of the web

smalltalk assignment #0 
assigned 4/25, (not to hand in).



the assignment (you will be helped through this in section):
 log on to the nt workstation.
 start smalltalk.
 change the path of the  changes file, and save 
the image in your local file space.  (instructions in the 
lab, or on the web.)
 exit smalltalk, and re-start it, but this time use your 
own smalltalk image.
 type in the code for a very simple ``bank account''
class, explained and listed below.
 test the code (in a workspace) on a couple of simple examples 
of your own devising.
 file out your new category.





 the scenario:

for the smalltalk part of the class we will be looking 
at banks and bank accounts again.  with that in mind 
we will define some very simple code for manipulating 
bank accounts.  we will define these classes:
  account---an account will have a number, 
a balance and a list of transactions.  an 
account should be able to answer its account number, 
to accept deposits and withdrawals, and to provide 
a displayed list of its transactions.   for this cut 
at the code we will do very primitive output:  we will 
create a window for each account and let it display its
transactions to its own window.  (you do not need to understand
exactly how this works.)

therefore the account class will have the following instance variables:
number, balance,  transactions, and 
displayer.  the next available account number will be 
stored using a class variable.  (we will talk in class about
instance variables and class variables. for now, just notice 
how we put them into the code.)

the methods for an account will be the following:
 number answer the account's number.
 deposit: anamount on: adate  add the (numeric) argument
anamount to the account's balance.  also add the 
transaction to the list of transactions.
 withdraw: anamount on: adate  deduct the (numeric) argument
anamount from the account's balance, and add the transaction 
to the account's transaction list.   signal an error if the balance 
is insufficient.


  transaction---this class will store the amount of the 
transaction (deposit or withdrawal) and the date on which it occurred.
its instance variables will therefore be amount and date.
the transaction class should also be able to display itself on a window.


on the next page you will find code for the transaction and 
account classes.  in section you will learn how 
to enter these into the smalltalk image.

========================================
this code defines the transaction class
========================================

1.  class definition for transaction:

   object subclass: transaction
     instancevariablenames: 'amount date'
     classvariablenames: ''

========================================

2.  class method for transaction:

    newamount: anamount date: adate 
       &quot;answer an instance of a transaction object
        with the specified date and amount. 
        sample:
            transaction newamount: 100 date: date today.&quot;

    ^self new initializeamount: anamount date: adate.

========================================

3.  instance methods for transaction:

    initializeamount: anamount date: adate 
      &quot;this method is called only when a new instance is 
       created.  it just sets the instance's variables.&quot;

        amount := anamount.
        date := adate.
        ^self.

   =================================

   displayon: atextcollector 
     &quot;print a single line describing this transaction.&quot;

    amount &lt; 0
        iftrue:  [atextcollector show: 'withdrawal of  $']
        iffalse: [atextcollector show: 'deposit of  $'].
    atextcollector show: amount printstring; 
                   show: ' on '; 
                   show: date printstring; 
                   cr.


========================================
this code defines the account class
========================================

    object subclass: account
       instancevariablenames: 'number balance displayer transactions'
       classvariablenames: 'nextnumber '


========================================
1.  class methods for account
========================================

     new
       &quot;answer a new instance of account with next number,   
        balance 0, and empty transactions.&quot;

    ^self basicnew initialize.

   =====================================

     initialize
       &quot;to initialize the account class we set the 
        next account number to 1.&quot;

        nextnumber := 1.


========================================
2.  instance methods for account
========================================

     initialize
       &quot;to initialize an instance of account, we 
        initialize the instance variables and open 
        a window to display the transactions.&quot;

       number := nextnumber.
       nextnumber := nextnumber + 1.
       balance := 0.
       transactions := orderedcollection new.
            &quot;this sets up the display window&quot;
       displayer := textcollector new.
       textcollectorview open: displayer label: 'account window'.

       ^self.

       ===================================
      
      number
        &quot;answer the receiver's account number&quot;
        ^number.

       ===================================
      
      deposit: anamount on: adate
        &quot;to deposit, adjust the balance, and make up 
         a new transaction object with the specified amount
         and date.&quot;

        balance := balance + anamount.
        transactions addlast: (transaction newamount: anamount date: adate).

       ===================================

       withdraw:  anamount on: adate 
         &quot;to withdraw, check to see if the balance is sufficient, 
          if so adjust balance and generate a new transaction.

         balance &lt; anamount iftrue: 
            [ self error: 'attempt to overdraw account.'].
         balance := balance - anamount.
         transactions addlast: (transaction newamount: anamount negated  
                                            date: adate).

       
       ===================================


        displaytransactions
          &quot;display all the transactions on the account's window.
           first print a header.&quot;

          displayer show: 'transactions for account '; 
                    show: number printstring; 
                    cr.

          transactions do: [:trans |  displayer show: '  '.  
                                      trans displayon: displayer].

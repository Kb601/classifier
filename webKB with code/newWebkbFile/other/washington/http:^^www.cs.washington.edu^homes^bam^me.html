to know me is to love me (yeah, whatever...)




 stuff about bam 


i spent my undergraduate daze at the university of maryland at college park.
other schools brag about their nobel laureates.  we had jim henson.  we rule.
once i graduated i did some applied math research on tricycles at umcp.  (my boss called
them wheeled mobile robots.) fortunately my boss encouraged me to make
lots of pretty pictures.  

 yes i interned for microsoft last summer so i could
work with linguistics-related tools.  knock off the "don't drink the
water" jokes.  i actually liked it there. if you still can't deal with
this, go vent your
spleen.  

 find out about some personal stuff about me.  look at my quote file.  see some poems and songs i like.  become a groupie for
my fictitious all-female thrash band.
find out where my whole phoenix
motif comes from.

 i'm actually good for something
in this world, and i have a résumé to prove it.

 the bam at
wam dot um dee doo purity
test

 some original works i actually feel like
making public, and mossy
bits, the department's literary magazine which features them.  i'm
co-editor of mossy bits this year, so send me any ideas you have.

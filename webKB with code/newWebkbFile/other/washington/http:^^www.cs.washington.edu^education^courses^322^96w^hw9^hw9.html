let  and
 be nfas.
construct a new nfa m that accepts the language

think of l as the set of arbitrary shuffles of strings from  and
.  for example, if aab is in  and bb is in  then
the strings aabbb, ababb, bbaab and many other strings are in l.
hint: the machine will have to run both  and  in parallel, but
only one at a time.  thus, a cross product-like construction is in order.

you don't have to prove that your construction is correct, but you must
state a behavioral lemma which could be used in such a proof.


show that the set of all strings over the alphabet  with an
equal number of a's as b's is not a regular set.  you may use closure
properties of regular languages and the fact that the language
 is not regular.


show that the language  is not regular.  
you will have prove this by contradiction from first principles.

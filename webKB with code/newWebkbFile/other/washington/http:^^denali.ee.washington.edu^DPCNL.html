 the lab
as our name implies, our research centers around dependable parallel computers and networks.  our research in fault tolerance and reliability result in the
"dependable" part of our name.  our research also includes
"parallel computers", computer architecture and "networks".  this lab is led by
professor arun k.
somani 
 and
professor james
meditch.

our research into dependability includes issues in reliability, dependability
and fault tolerance in all aspects of computer systems
and networks.  currently we have active work occurring in the 
area of fault propagation in cache memory to
determine effective protocols for detecting and correcting faults 
in cache memories.

we are building a comprehensive reliablity analysis tool ,himap, the hierarchical modeling and analysis package.


our research into parallel computers and parallel algorithms
ranges from interconnection networks and architecture to efficient partitioning 
methods for parallel algorithms.  currently we have ongoing research
in the proteus 
parallel computer, a machine designed and implemented in this lab in
conjunction with the
applied physics lab
here at the university of washington.    this machine is used for
applications such as real time
imaging, visualization, and rendering
in both 2 and 3 dimensions.

our research into networks is far ranging. 
topics range from  video
transmission in atm networks, in which we try to characterize
traffic sources in atm networks and address the issues of bandwidth allocation,
to high speed networks
in which we address issues in multicasting, and other inter-networking issues. another
topic of research is optical networking.
currently, we are looking at certain issues in wavelength-routing networks.

currently, 9 phd students and 3 ms students are working in the laboratory.
the dpcnl computer resources consist of 9 sun sparcstations,
a mac iici, a gateway pentium 60, and a configuration
of proteus parallel machine (12 pe).  in addition we also have access
to a  32 pe proteus, a 16 node intel paragon machine, and a 53 node ksr at the university of washington.

we also have access to video digitizers and sources
of video streams. the proteus (intel i860-based) parallel processor
can also be used for processing of information at high speed and
to generate realistic input data streams. our latest acquisition is
a 4-port atm switch from fore systems. the switch is being used by the 
atm group for research in the field of video image transfer and analysis.
 the switch will also be used to demonstrate its role in an all-optical network backbone in the new ee/cs/cse 
 building.

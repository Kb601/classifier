problem set #1







problem 1
you have been hired by the wisconsin department of transportation
to computerize traffic control at a 3-way intersection (pictured below).






the east-west street is one-way (westbound).
the north-south street is two-way.
the rules for this intersection are:


each car (process) arriving at the intersection will call a
procedure enter(indir, outdir),
where indir
and outdir
are parameters whose value is one of the defined constants:
north, south, east, or west.
the parameter indir
is the direction that you enter the intersection, and outdir
is the direction that you will leave the intersection.
this procedure returns only when it is safe to proceed through the intersection.

after leaving the intersection, the car (process) must call
procedure leave(outdir),
where outdir
is defined the same as above.

cars can proceed straight or make legal turns.
u turns are illegal.

if cars are waiting from both the north and east directions,
they should proceed at the same time if they
can safely do so.

if cars are waiting from both the north and east directions,
and they cannot both safely proceed at the same time, they
must alternate (this prevents starvation).

the east-west street has a single lane.
the north-south street has two lanes - one in either direction.


you are to write the code for the
enter()
and
leave()
procedures.
you can assume that you are supplied with (already written) a procedure
called
drivethroughtheintersection().
you have no idea how long this procedure takes to execute.

you should write three versions of the program.
for all three of these programs, you should use the c++.


the first program will be written using semaphores as the synchronization
mechanism.
assume that car each is a process.
you are to define the global variables (including semaphores) that are to be
used, and how they are initialized.
you are to then write the code that the cars
will use.


the second program will be written using monitors.
use c++ with monitor classes (as we have done in lecture).
again, assume that each car is a process.
you are to first describe the monitor(s) that will be used by the cars.
for each monitor, you should describe the data maintained by the monitor,
and the initial values.
you should also describe the procedures within each monitor that are used
for synchronization.
last, describe the code that the cars use
(to call the monitors, etc.) to be properly synchronized.

the procedures
enter()
and
leave()
will probably
not
be in a monitor, or else rule 4 will be difficult to obey.
enter()
and
leave()
will probably call
procedures within a monitor (or monitors).


the third program will be written using messages.
assume that we have processes communicating via messages.
the processes do not have any shared memory.
each mail box has a unique name, which is a character string
(like
bart
or
hithere).

you will have three communications primitives,
send,
receive,
and
createmailbox.
the send operation looks like:

send (const char *mailboxname, const char *contents)


the
mailboxname
is a string naming the destination mail box and
you might want to use names such as
waitqueue
or
trafficcop.
the
contents
are anything you want to send in the message.
the send operation does not block, and we will assume that there are
no error cases (like unknown mail box) to be handled.
after a send, you know that the message is queued in the mail box.
the receive operation looks like:

receive (const char *mailboxname, char *contents)


the
mailboxname
is a string naming the mail box.
the receive operation blocks until a message gets delivered.
if a message is already available, or if a message arrives after the
receiver has blocked, then the receive returns.
when the receive returns, the
contents
gets filled in with the contents that were sent with the message.

the create operation looks like:

createmailbox (const char *mailboxname)


the
mailboxname
is a string naming the newly created mail box.
mail box names must be unique.

you are to design the code that will be executed by each process.
as with the first two programs, assume that each car is a process.
you may also create any extra processes that you find useful.




problem 2

you are given a system that has binary semaphores.
that is, you can declare variables with the class
binsem,
and you can perform the constructor and
binp() and
binv()
methods on these variables.

using these binary semaphores, you are to implement general semaphores
on this system.
you will define a new class called
gensem
and write the code for the constructor and
genp and
genv
methods.



problem 3

a important aspect of multiprocessing is using multiple
processes to concurrently compute a single problem.
with this in mind, write a c++
program that uses four processes to multiply two 4 by 4
matrices a and b, and store the result in (the 4 by 4
matrix) c.
the heart of your program will be a procedure called
matrixmult(row, column),
that multiples row row of a times
column column of b and stores it in
c[row,column].
assume the matrices are in memory global to all the processes.

what (if any) synchronization mechanisms or primitives do you need for
your solution?
why?

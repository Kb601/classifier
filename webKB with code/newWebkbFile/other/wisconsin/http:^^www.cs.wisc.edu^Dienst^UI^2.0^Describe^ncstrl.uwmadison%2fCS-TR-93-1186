 the problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by a plane, attempting to separate two point sets with intersecting convex hulls in $n$-dimensional real space, is formulated as a linear program with equilibrium constraints (lpec). this general lpec can be converted to an exact penalty problem with a quadratic objective and linear constraints. a frank-wolfe-type algorithm is proposed for the penalty problem that terminates at a stationary point or a global solution. novel aspects of the approach include: (i) a linear complementarity formulation of the step function that ``counts'' misclassifications, (ii) exact penalty formulation without boundedness, nondegeneracy or constraint qualification assumptions, (iii) an exact solution extraction from the sequence of minimizers of the penalty function for a finite value of the penalty parameter for the general lpec and an explicitly exact solution for the lpec with uncoupled constraints, and (iv) a parametric quadratic programming formulation of the lpec associated with the misclassification minimization problem.

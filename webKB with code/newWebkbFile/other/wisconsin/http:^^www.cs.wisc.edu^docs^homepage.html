8 easy steps to having your own www page



 8 easy steps to having your own www page on the cs unix machines

 in this document we will go through a step-by-step procedure for creating
a simple www home page on the departmental workstations.  it should take 
you about 30
minutes to complete the steps described here.  the page you create will 
probably not be exactly what you want, but going through these instructions
will give you a general idea of what is involved in creating web pages,
and after you understand more of how the system works you can go back and
edit or replace it.  some of what is said in this document isn't strictly
true, as you will see when you continue learning about the web.

  note:  the term home page has come to 
mean two different things.  some people refer to a page that describes 
a person or institution as its "home page."  others think a "home page" 
is a page you create for your own use that contains a list of links to 
the sites you visit frequently.  the page you are creating is of the 
first type. 

 step 0: what you should have in front of you.

 chances are you have probably completed most of this step already.
this document assumes you are logged into the console of a unix workstation
in the cs department, and that you are running mosaic for x to view 
this page.  if you are using some other browser or you aren't logged into
a cs machine, some of the instructions below won't work and might not
make sense, and you will have to move or be prepared to improvise.  

 you will probably want to read both this document and the page you
are editing at the same time, so to make that easier you can create a 
second mosaic window.  keeping in mind that you will have to put the first
window back on top to continue reading, press the "new window" button on 
the bottom of mosaic.  we'll use this other window later.

 in addition to mosaic, you should have a window with a shell available
because you will be typing a few commands.  finally, you should have 
your favorite text editor in a fourth window.  this document doesn't assume 
any html-specific editor modes; you will be editing the file directly.  make 
sure you can switch between the windows easily. 

 step 1: create your public www directory.

 if you have never put a document on the web, you will need to create your
publicly accessible www directory.  in your shell, execute the following
command: 

mkdir ~/public/html

 this directory is where you will keep all of your web documents.  it has
a special place in the namespace of our web server.  if this command did
not work because you do not have a ~/public directory, you have to
do a little more work.  please see this note.

 step 2: copy the sample home page.

 in your shell, run the following command:

cp /common/www/home-sample.html ~/public/html/username.html

 where username is your own unix login name.  this file contains
a www home page for you to personalize.

 step 3: edit the home page file.

 what you do to accomplish this will depend on what editor you use.  the
first few lines of the file should look like this:

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;felix's home page&lt;title&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

 don't change anything yet.  

 step 4: view the document in mosaic.

in the other mosaic window you created,
click on the open... button at the bottom.  a dialog box with a 
text field and some buttons will appear.  if there is anything in the text 
field, press the clear button.  now type

http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~username/

 in the text field.  if you make a mistake, the backspace key
should delete the character before the cursor, and the delete key 
should delete the character after it. 

 in the other mosaic window there should be a short list of directories
and files, one of which is username.html.  just as the 
string ~username/public/html/ is a complete path in the
filesystem pointing to the directory you created, the string
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~username/ is a complete path (or
full url) to
that same directory in the web namespace.  if you had wanted to load the
document directly, you could have entered

http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~username/username.html

 however, the server was nice enough to make a directory listing for you,
so you can just click on the name of the file to view it.  

 step 5: examine the file.

 the file you are editing is written in html, the hypertext markup 
language.  we are not going to go into detail about html here, but there is
a reasonably complete description in another 
document.  here is an 
over-simplified summary of html markup.  as you read it, look for examples 
in the file:

 
 markup in html is done with elements and entities.
 elements consist of tags, which are names inside
angle brackets, as in &lt;title&gt;.
 tag names are not case-sensitive.
 some elements are containers, which consist of two
tags: a start tag and an end tag.  start tags and end tags
are generally the same, except that end tags start with a "/".  for
example, if &lt;foo&gt; is a start tag, &lt;/foo&gt; is
its end tag.  whatever is between the start and end tags is inside the 
container.
 entities are names that start with &amp; and end 
with ; that represent characters which cannot normally 
be written in ascii, and characters used for markup.  
 the only entities you need to know right now are &amp;lt; 
for &lt;, &amp;gt; for &gt;, and &amp;amp;
for &amp;.  


 also notice that tabs, spaces, and newlines 
separate words, but are otherwise interchangeable.  you can format your
html document however you want to, and any combination of "whitespace" 
characters will not have an effect on the finished product.  while there
is a blank line between paragraphs in the sample file, it is the 
&lt;p&gt; tags that cause space to be included in the
mosaic window.

 to make an html document, you simply need to know the elements and 
entities and how to use them.  the use of entities is very simple.  whenever
you need to enter a character special or markup character into your document,
instead of typing the character itself you type the entity.  the use of 
elements is more complicated, so for now we will just tell you what you
need to know to alter the sample home page.

 there are a number of tags that get included in every document that we
will not discuss.  here we will only discuss the title, and the 
body.

 step 6:  edit the title.

 the third line of the sample home page looks like this:

&lt;title&gt;felix's home page&lt;/title&gt;

 if you look at the top of your mosaic window where it says "document 
title:" you will see that the string in the title container is
displayed there.  different browsers use the title in different ways.  the
title should be short and summarize the contents of the document.  in this 
case you can replace "felix" with your own name.  

 after you have made the change, save the file without exiting your editor
and press the reload button on the bottom of the other mosaic window.  
the new title should appear.  from now on, whenever you make changes to the 
file you can save it in your editor and reload it into your browser to see 
the result.

 step 7:  edit the body.

 the body is everything between the &lt;body&gt; and
&lt;/body&gt; tags (if you look at the end of the document, you
will see the &lt;/body&gt; tag).  the body is where you put your
text, entities, and most of the elements.  the sample file has a number of 
elements you might want to use in your own home page.  don't delete a
sample element until you have left at least one example of its use in 
the file or decided you don't want to use it.

 as you look at the sample page in your editor and in mosaic it should
become clear what the different elements do in mosaic for x.  
different browsers have different interpretations of the tags.  here is a 
list of the elements in the document and what they do in mosaic:


 &lt;b&gt; is a container that emboldens its contents.
 &lt;em&gt; is a container that italicizes its contents (em stands for emphasis).
 &lt;h1&gt; is a container that creates a heading. 
 &lt;p&gt; separates paragraphs.
 &lt;ul&gt; creates a "bullet-ed list" (ul stands for unordered list).
 &lt;li&gt; is used to specify list items inside a list container.
 &lt;a&gt; is used to make a link to another document.
 &lt;img&gt; is used to include a picture.


 there are also a number of elements not included in the sample document.  
here is a list of some of them:


 &lt;h2&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; are like &lt;h1&gt; and create headings with progressively smaller fonts.
 &lt;ol&gt; is like &lt;ul&gt;, but creates a numbered
list (ol stands for ordered list).
 &lt;hr&gt; makes a horizontal rule.
 &lt;br&gt; inserts a line break.


 two of the included tags, &lt;a&gt; and &lt;img&gt;, 
had attributes.  the a container was used to create a link to 
another document, which was specified in the 
href="/cgi-bin/finger?keeper@spacely" attribute.  in this case,
that document is a script that fingers a user (keeper@spacely) and 
creates a document with the result.  note that path (url) to the
document starts with a "/".  when you link from one document to another 
in the web, you can refer to the new location relative to the current one.
in this case, we could omit the http://www.cs.wisc.edu because
both documents are on the same server.  

 the &lt;img&gt; tag, as we said before, is used to include a
picture.  the picture must be either an x bitmap, or a gif file.  the 
src attribute is used to specify the location of the picture.  the 
filenames of x bitmaps must end with the extension .xbm and gif 
filenames must end in .gif.  if you had a gif file called 
me.gif, and you wanted to include it in your document, you could
put it in the same directory where the document is located, and use the
tag &lt;img src="me.gif"&gt;.  the alt attribute specifies
a string to be printed if a browser cannot display pictures. 

 now that you know what the elements do, you should figure out what 
you want to say (the hard part), and then use the tags and text to create the 
"look" you want.  remember that you can preview what you create in mosaic
as you go along by saving the document and clicking the reload
button.

 every night, every page that matches the pattern 
~username/public/html/username.html is mapped
into the master list of home pages.

 step 8:  read the other documents.

 you don't have to read them now, but before you do more work with html or 
the server you should get the complete description of how they work.  in 
particular, read the html document.  
using mosaic to test your html for
correctness can leave your documents looking pretty in mosaic, and 
non-sensical in other browsers.

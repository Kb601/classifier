research programs

 

 
the department emphasizes both research teams and traditional research
activities by individual faculty members and their students. in group
efforts, several faculty, scientific staff and graduate students
support one another. for example, theoretical work by some team
members supports experimental work by others. also, team members share
equipment, work side by side, organize common-interest seminars, and
so on. the groups described below often involve faculty, scientific
staff and graduate students from several departments, adding a strong
interdisciplinary flavor to the research.

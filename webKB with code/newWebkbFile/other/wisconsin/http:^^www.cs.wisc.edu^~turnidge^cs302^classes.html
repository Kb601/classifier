classes




classes

a class is an extension of a struct.  i will introduce classes slowly
by extending the functionality of structs, which we studied last week.

one of the most apparent differences between a class and a struct
is that, in addition to having "data members" like a struct, a class
can have "member functions" or "methods".  we can think about these
member functions as being operations that all objects that belong to
the class can do.  for example, imagine that we wanted to augment our
alien struct that we declared last week so that every alien is capable
of giving a greeting.  we would declare our class as so:


const int maxstr = 20;

class alien
{
  public:
    char name[maxstr];
    char homeplanet[maxstr];
    int numlegs;
    int isdeadly;

    void greet(char who[]);
};

notice that we have added an additional member, called
greet to the class alien.  unlike the other members, this
member is not declared to be a variable or array.  this member is a
prototype for a function which takes an array of characters and
produces no return value.  we have also added the word public which we
will talk about later.


now, a prototype is only half of a function.  we need to
give a function definition.  it could look like this:


void alien::greet (char who[])
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "hello " &lt;&lt; who
	&lt;&lt; ", my name is " &lt;&lt; name
	&lt;&lt; " and i am from " &lt;&lt; homeplanet
	&lt;&lt; ".\nlet's be friends for ever!\n";
}


this looks a lot like a normal function definition.  we have a return
type (void), we have a parameter list (char who[]) and we have some
code making up the function body.  what is different is the function
name alien::greet.  in our class declaration, our prototype
has only the name greet.  what's going on here?  well, it is
possible that more than one class might have a method (member
function) called greet.  for example, there might be a robot class and
it might have a greet method too.  in order to specify which
greet method we are providing the body for, we need to give the class
name.  that is why our function is called alien::greet.  you
can read this name as meaning "the greet method for the alien class."
the :: thing is called the "scope resolution operator."  this is
because it is used to specify that its second operand (in this case
"greet") is the one specified in the "scope" of its first operand (in
this case "alien").  the :: is used whenever we want to grab a part of
a class.  we will see additional uses for the :: operator later.

some of you might be saying, hold on one second, we are using the
variables "name" and "homeplanet" in the greet method without them
being declared in the method body.  this is ok.  we will see what this
means soon.

we have defined the greet method for the alien class.  now we
just need to call it.  suppose we have a couple of aliens.


// this appears somewhere, maybe in main...
alien yoda;
alien darth;


we have not yet talked about initializing objects.  for the time
being, assume that yoda has name "yoda" and home planet "dagobah" and
darth has name "lord vader" and home planet "the death star".  we can
call the greet functions for both by the code:


...
// this appears somewhere, maybe in main...
yoda.greet("dad");
darth.greet("mom");
...


we call a method for a particular object (variable) by using "the dot
operator".  we have done this before with file streams (remember
cin.getline() and fin.getline()?).  we have also seen this as a way of
accessing the data members of structs.  basically, the dot operator is
used whenever we want to grab a piece of an object (contrast with
scope resolution operator).  the first line says 'call the greet
method for the yoda object with the argument "dad"' the second line
says 'call the greet method for the darth object with the argument
"mom"'.  you can also think of these lines as being like messages to
the objects.  we first tell yoda to greet dad and then we tell darth
to greet mom.  the reason that we call variables like yoda and darth
"objects" is that they are, in an abstract sense, entities that can
receive messages and interact with each other.

when we make the calls, the variables "name" and "homeplanet" will
correspond to whichever object makes the call.  when yoda is asked to
greet dad he will be from dagobah.  when darth is asked to greet mom
he will be from the death star.  the above two calls generate the
screen output:


hello dad, my name is yoda and i am from dagobah.
let's be friends for ever!
hello mom, my name is lord vader and i am from the death star.
let's be friends for ever!


exercise: extend the class declaration to include a method called
mutate which takes an integer and returns nothing.  write a method
definition for mutate which adds its integer argument to the aliens
number of legs, "mutating" it.  it should accept negative arguments.
at no time should an alien's numlegs drop below zero.

(solution).

constructors

below this point these notes are written for my lecture.  they
are very terse and will likely not make sense.  i am leaving them here
because it doesn't make sense to remove them:

first example:


class alien
{
  public:
    char name[maxstr];
    char homeplanet[maxstr];
    int numlegs;
    int isdeadly;

    alien(char nm[], char home[], int legs, int deadly);
    void greet(char who[]);
    void mutate(int morelegs);
};

alien::alien (char nm[], char home[], int legs, int deadly)
{
    strcpy(name, nm);
    strcpy(homeplanet, home);
    numlegs = legs;
    isdeadly = deadly;
}



overloaded:


class alien
{
  public:
    char name[maxstr];
    char homeplanet[maxstr];
    int numlegs;
    int isdeadly;

    alien();
    alien(char nm[], char home[], int legs, int deadly);
    void greet(char who[]);
    void mutate(int morelegs);
};

alien::alien ()
{
    //set to reasonable defaults
    name[0] = '\0';
    homeplanet[0] = '\0';
    numlegs = 0;
    isdeadly = 0;
}

alien::alien (char nm[], char home[], int legs, int deadly)
{
    strcpy(name, nm);
    strcpy(homeplanet, home);
    numlegs = legs;
    isdeadly = deadly;
}


point: why don't we call strcpy (name, "") instead?

two constructors.  talk about how we decide which to call (parameters,
types, of args).  typical overloaded function.  show example:


  //in main or some other function...
  alien generra;  // no init values, calls lame-o constructor.
  alien gamera ("gamera", "tokyo 7", 2, 1);

points to ponder: why doesn't generra have the ()'s?  what would
happen if it did?

no args constructor is called default constructor.  good idea to
have one because you probably will want it. (e.g. when you make an
array of classes!)

you can use = to assign one whole class to another:


generra = gamera;


you can also call the constructor explicitly to make an anaonymous
value of a certain type and assign it:


generra = alien("et", "home", 2, 0);



alien::


example where i use it to resolve name clash in constructor:


alien::alien (char name[], char homeplanet[], int numlegs, int isdeadly)
{
    strcpy(alien::name, name);
    strcpy(alien::homeplanet, homeplanet);
    alien::numlegs = numlegs;
    alien::isdeadly = isdeadly;
}


constant member: 


class alien
{
  public:
    // ...

    const int killer = 1;
    const int lamb = 0;
    // ...
};


can use the killer and lamb constants in our alien methods.  can also
use them in calls:


    alien yoda("yoda", "dagobah", 2, alien::killer);


this way we can hide the "magic number".  point: why can't we do this
with non-constants?

friday's class

public v. private

talk about the separation of implementation and interface.  it
would help to have an example of two different ways of doing the same
thing.  preferably something i have shown before.

define impl and intf

idea: provide a common interface that hides the details of
implementation.  this way we can replace code later.

can also avoid things like: yoda.numlegs = -2; //semantic error.

tell them how.  tell them what it means.  give some decls.  show
accessors/constructors.  


void alien::read ()
{
	char yorn;
	
	cout  ";
	cin >> ws;
	cin.getline (name, 20);
	cout  ";
	cin.getline (homeplanet, 20);
	cout  ";
	cin >> numlegs;
	cout  ";
	cin >> yorn;
	isdeadly = (toupper(yorn) == 'y');
}

contrast with:

void readinalien (alien &lifeform)
{
	char yorn;
	
	cout  ";
	cin >> ws;
	cin.getline (lifeform.name, 20);
	cout  ";
	cin.getline (lifeform.homeplanet, 20);
	cout  ";
	cin >> lifeform.numlegs;
	cout  ";
	cin >> yorn;
	lifeform.isdeadly = (toupper(yorn) == 'y');
}


accessor functions

tips: make all member variables private, define accessor functions,
use the assignment operator.

scc: the safe c compiler




scc: the safe c compiler



what is scc?


scc is an optimizing c-to-c compiler which implements the extended pointer
and array access semantics needed to provide efficient, reliable and immediate
detection of memory access errors in unbridled c codes.  the
safe programming technologies used in scc are described in the following
papers:




  efficient detection of all pointer and array access errors,
  todd m. austin, scott e. breach, and gurindar s. sohi,
  proceedings of the acm sigplan '94 conference on programming
  language design and implementation, june 1994.


  efficient detection of all pointer and array access errors (extended
  version), todd m. austin, scott e. breach, and gurindar s. sohi,
  university of wisconsin - madison technical report #1197, december 1993.
  (a longer version of the pldi '94 paper).



here are 
slides from a talk i (todd austin) gave at pldi '94 in orlando, florida.  the talk detailed the first
incarnation of scc.  the implementation details are a bit dated, but the
description of the basic technology is still relevant.



how do i get scc?


the source release for scc version 1.0.0 is not publicly available from my
home page.  please send me e-mail (at austin@cs.wisc.edu) for the specifics
on its distribution.



who made scc?


scc is the result of research conducted by
todd austin,
scott breach,
and
guri sohi
of the
wisconsin multiscalar group
at the
university of wisconsin - madison.
scc was written by
todd austin
(austin@cs.wisc.edu).

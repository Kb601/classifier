cs367 exams


there will be three exams for cs367, two midterm and one final exam.
exams count for 50% of your final grade.  information on the exam
format, studying tips, and
topics for exam 1 may be found below.  topics for
the other exams will be added to this page as the semester progresses.
the exam dates are:


midterm 1  15%  wednesday  10/23/96  7:15 -  9:15 pm, 1361 chemistry
midterm 2  20%  tuesday    11/26/96  7:15 -  9:15 pm, tba
final      15%  wednesday  12/18/96  5:05 -  7:05 pm, tba


make-up exams for the midterms are given only with my permission when
you are unable to take the regular exam due to extenuating circumstances.
a request for a makeup exam must be made during my office hours, and must
be brought to my attention two weeks before the exam date.  i will waive
this requirement for verifiable emergencies, but no requests for make-ups
will be accepted after the actual exam is given.

there will be no make-up for the final.  final exam dates are listed in
the timetable so that students can avoid conflicting final exams.  




 exam format

 exams have from five to ten questions (some having multiple parts), are
 designed for a two hour exam period, and an average score of 70 points
 out of 100.

 exam questions fall into three categories, tracing code, writing code,
 and miscellaneous.  you can expect to see each of these three categories
 on the exams. tracing requires you demonstrate understanding of code
 provided by showing the output or results generated, diagraming code
 execution, or describing what code does in general.  coding questions
 require you to demonstrate your knowledge of data structures and c++
 syntax/semantics by writing c++ code to solve the particular problem
 described.  sometimes code is provided that you need to use or supplement
 to finish the question.  miscellaneous questions cover the broad spectrum
 of question styles such as true/false, fill in the blank, multiple choice,
 or short answer questions.  





 general studying tips

 prioritize your studying.  when i create the exams i consider
 first what we covered during lectures, then the programming assignments,
 and finally the reading materials.

 study your notes.  of course this is obvious, but many go about
 studying their notes in the wrong manner.  don't just highlight your notes
 and think that counts as reading them!  don't just reread your notes and
 think that counts as studying them   successful studying requires you to be
 more involved and actively thinking about the material.  one of the most
 effective ways to study is to reorganize and rewrite your notes in a
 succinct manner in terms that you understand. 

 avoid getting bogged down on specific points.  if you can figure
 something out, move on to other material and wait to ask me or the tas.

 you'll need to do some memorizing.  memorizing is a practical
 way to learn the definitions of terminology and concepts.  a good way to
 memorize information is through repeated exposure to the material. 

 form a study group.  it is often easier and more motivating to
 work with others when studying for an exam.  you can distribute the work
 by having each group member come up with a few questions, and then going
 over the solutions collectively.  if you run into a concept that causes
 confusion, often others in the group will have similar difficulty.
 together the group can figure something out more quickly than an
 individual, because of the multiple perspectives the members bring to
 the group.

 finally avoid cramming!  we all know this.  however, though we
 promise ourselves that we will start studying early, often we find
 ourselves waiting til too late.  this is a habit worth breaking.  studies
 have shown that studying in half hour to hour intervals followed by half
 hour breaks is far more effective than non-stop cramming.

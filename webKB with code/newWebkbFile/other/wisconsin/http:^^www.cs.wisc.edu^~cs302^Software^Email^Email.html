email

this information applies to the pc eudora email software in the 1370 lab. 
you access this through an icon labeled email in the 
networking folder.
if you have problems with your computer science email, you should
contact your ta or the computer systems lab.
our email service provider is not the same as the campus
wiscworld email service, so doit won't be able to help you
with any email problems.  you can, however, mail to any internet
address from the cs accounts, including wiscworld and cae accounts.



information on this page includes:
	
	starting the email application
	saving an email message
	sending an existing file through email
	changing your email password
	forwarding your email
	

starting the email application

in the "networking" folder in the program manager, double-click on the
application labelled "email".
your initial "mail" password is the same as your initial network password.
changing the network password, however, does not 

change your mail password.


saving an email message

if you're using the email software in the 1370 lab, select from the 
file menu the item save as. a dialog should appear.

if you're saving the message to be an input file, uncheck the items
guess paragraphs and include headers if they're checked.

click on the drives pop-up menu underneath the list of files to 
change the drive to u:, so that the file will be saved in your workspace.
if desired, change the u: directory by double-clicking on the directory
icons in the directories list. (to move out of the current directory,
click on the topmost directory icon.)

finally, press the okay button.

sending files through email

	while in the course you may find it useful to email a c++ source file
or other files to your instructor. 
	after you've started the email application, create a 
new message. enter the intended recipient's address and
a subject.
	next, select from the message menu the item 
attach document. in the dialog that appears, select the
document you wish to send.
	next, you must click off the text->doc button shown in the
icon bar. if you don't do this, your instructor will receive an unreadable
file.
	finally, you can press the send button.

changing your email password
	in the "networking" folder, double-click on the "change password" icon.
you'll be asked for your name and password again. from here, you can
change your email password.

note, that if you put in the wrong password too many times, you will
be locked out of your account for a little while for security reasons.

note: the change password option in eudora does
not work on our system.



forwarding your mail
unfortunately, the "automatic mail forward" program does not yet
work.  if you want your email to be forwarded automatically, please
send email to lab@cs.wisc.edu or
go to the 
computer systems lab
(on the second floor) during regular
business hours.

if you need to meet with any of the above outside the posted hours, you
can do so by setting up an appointment.
if you have questions that are not addressed by the text or the 
project documentation and handouts, i encourage you to send email.
(but do read these sources of clarification first!)  important
points arising out of these and other discussions will
be summarized in a continually updated  clarifications
html page.

turning in assignments


to turn in an assignment, two things need to be done.  if either of
these is not done on time, the program is considered late.


   a printout of your program must be turned into me at the
beginning of class on the day on which it is due.  to print a copy
of the program, go back to the file menu, and choose print.
click on ok in the little window that appears.  the pages will    
automatically be printed in the printer room across the hall (room 1359).
you can determine which printer will do the printing by checking out the
check print queues icon in the administration folder.  (it
may take a few seconds to show your name).

   you must copy all of your files (program code, test files, output
files, and executable) to the handin directory.  to do this, start the 

file manager, select the copy... option from the file
menu.  in the next window enter the following in the ``from:'' field,  
 "u:\programs\progn", where n is the number of
the program, in this case type "u:\programs\prog0". in the   
``to:'' field, enter "r:\handin\milo\username", where
username is your login name.

wisconsin cow  



 wisconsin cow 



wisconsin cluster of workstations (cow) is a collection of 40 sun
sparcstation-20s (soon to be) connected by a high-speed network (probably
myricom myrinet).  each workstation has two ross hypersparc processors,
64 mb of memory, and two 1-gb disks.

those with an eye to computer history may be amused that the cow is housed
in venerable pdp-11 racks.

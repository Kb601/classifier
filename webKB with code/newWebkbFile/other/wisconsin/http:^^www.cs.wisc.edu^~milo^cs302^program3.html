program description

due to the great cash register program that you wrote for the
restaurant, you have earned quite a reputation and your skills are in
high demand.  a large hardware distributor, we 'r nails, has
contracted you to write a program to replace an old cash register. 

this program will be an even greater challenge than the restaurant
because of a number of added complications.  first, the price a
customer pays for each nail decreases as the quantity ordered
increases.  this is described in detail below.  second, the warehouse
has a finite number of nails in stock, and your program must not allow
the operator to place an order for more of one type of nail than is in
stock. 

the cost of ordering some number of one type of nail can be calculated
from the quantity ordered and the base price of each nail.  the more
nails that a customer orders, the less the customer pays per nail.
the discount schedule is as follows:


   first 1000: regular price
   next  1000: 10% discount
   next  1000: 15% discount
   after that: 25% discount


for example, the price of 1300 items at 10 cents a piece would be
(1000*10) + (300*9) cents = $127.00, not (1300 * 9) cents.
note that if the user orders 800 of a particular item at one point,
and later orders 500 more of the same item, she should be given the
discount as if she ordered all 1300 at once. 

we 'r nails sells four types of nails.  below is a chart of the
item number, description, base cost per nail, and quantity on hand in
the warehouse.


 item #    item description	cost per nail   number in warehouse
====================================================================
  315         2.0" nails           $0.025            15000
  426         3.0" nails           $0.030            20000
  537         4.0" nails           $0.035            25000
  648         9.0" nails           $0.050            30000


customers can only order by the box (there are 100 nails to the box,
regardless of size). 

similar to the last program, you need prompt the user for the order,
keep track of how many of each item have been ordered, loop until the
user asks for the bill, display the final bill.  however, this program
requires that you prompt the user for the item number and quantity
ordered.  you may design the menu and bill formats yourself, but, as
in your previous assignment, all dollar amounts must be formatted to 2
decimal places. 

 constants variables should be used where appropriate and all input
should be checked to make sure it is valid.  if the input is not
valid, tell the user, and re-prompt the user for input.  (these
statements apply to all programs from now on.)

code provided

since the object of this assignment is to give you practice using
functions, i have provided the basic framework and main
function for you to build the other functions upon.  it is your job to
complete the functions which "fill-in" the program and perform the
desired operations.  you must use the following code as your
main function with no modifications to the code:


// your header comments go here

#include &ltiostream.h&gt

const int true = 1;
const int false = 0;

// your function prototypes go here

int main() {
  int choice;    // item number
  int quantity;  // quantity ordered

  int num_ord1 = 0, num_ord2 = 0; // cumulative number of each item ordered
  int num_ord3 = 0, num_ord4 = 0;

  do {
    // prompt the user and get the input
    print_menu(num_ord1, num_ord2, num_ord3, num_ord4);
    choice = get_choice();
    quantity = get_quantity();
    
    // process the order
    place_order(choice, quantity, num_ord1, num_ord2, num_ord3, num_ord4);
    
  } while (keep_going() == true); // ask the user if they want to continue

  // display the bill summarizing the items ordered.
  print_bill(num_ord1, num_ord2, num_ord3, num_ord4);
}



functions to write


the following is a list of functions that you must write for
the assignment.  some of these procedures will only require
call-by-value parameters, others will need to use call-by-reference
parameters.  it is up to you to figure out how many and what types the
parameters are.

 

 print_menu - this function should print the menu and the
current subtotal (not including tax).

 calculate_subtotal - this function should compute the subtotal
(not including tax) of the items ordered so far.

 calculate_price - this function (which will be called by
calculate_subtotal) should take two arguments: quantity ordered of a
particular item, and the price of the item.  it then computes the cost
using the rules in the above program description.

 get_choice - this function should prompt the user for an
item number.  you must ensure that the return value is a legitimate
item number.  if the user enters an invalid choice, an error message
should be printed, and the user should be reprompted for a new number.

 get_quantity - this function should prompt the user for the
quantity of the order.  you must ensure that the return value is a
legitimate quantity (remember, if you have the user enter the number of
nails desired, the number must be divisible by 100 to be valid, since
nails come in 100 item packages).  if the user enters an invalid
choice, an error message should be printed, and the user should be
reprompted for a new number.

 place_order - this function will attempt to place the
order, adjusting the appropriate num_ordx.  if the
total quantity of the item requested is greater than the stock on-hand,
as much as possible of the order should be filled, and an informative
out of stock message should be displayed.  this message should display
which item was out of stock and the quantity to which the order was
reduced.

 if the ordering of an item causes the available stock to drop
below 10,000 items, a descriptive "low on item" message should be
printed, along with the appropriate item number.

 keep_going - this function should ask the user whether
they would like to continue ordering items (or, it could ask the user
if they want to print the bill.)  either way, it should return true if
the loop is to be executed again, and false otherwise.  (true and
false are integer constants that are included in the code for
main.)

 print_bill - this function should print the number of
each item ordered (only the items which the customer ordered more than
zero of), the subtotal, and the final total (adding in 5% tax) in a
way that is similar to the last program.



 

what to turn in

once you have your program working, you should print sample runs of
the program.  your output file should demonstrate ordering quantities
of the items such that various discount levels are calculated, orders
that exceed the available items in stock, orders that cause a stock
low message to be displayed, and an example where two requests for the
same item are handled properly. (as one large request.)

as always, submit print-outs of both your source code and your sample
program runs, and an submit an electronic copy of your source code and
executable as described previously.

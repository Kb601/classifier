programming assignment #1

(due thursday, february 8, at 5pm)



i/o processing in c++
there are several goals for this assignment.
first, you will get a chance to familiarize yourself with the c++
programming language.
second, you will learn how to use some of the i/o facilities and library
functions provided by unix and c++.
third, you will write code that will be useful for future assignments.

your assignment is to write a program that takes an input file, reads through
it line by line, do some simple processing on each line, and then produces
some output.
your program, to be called
writer,
will be invoked:

	writer filename

your program will open file
filename
and process it as described below in
program details.
unix manual pages
you should become familiar with the unix manuals and the online
"man" facility.
this will be a great help in working on these assignments.
for example, if you wanted to know how the
fork
(create process) system call works, you would type:

	man fork

the unix manual is organized into many sections.
you will be mainly interested in the first three sections.
section 1 is for commands, like
ls,
g++,
or
cc.
section 2 is for unix system calls (calls directly to the unix kernel),
such as
fork,
open,
or
read.
you will typically not
use section 2.
most of what you use will be in the unix library routines in section 3.
these are calls such as
atof,
or
strcpy.
more details about the online manual will be given in discussion sections.

program details

your program will first print out the name of the input file.
then it will open a file (perhaps using the
ifstream
constructor), read each
line (using the
getline method)
and process them.
for more information on c++ input/output, you can read the c++ book or
type

	man iostream
	man fstream


each line is of the form:

character-string  number1  number2

each of these three pieces will be separated by any number of blank characters
(spaces or tabs).
the numbers can have decimal points and fractional parts.
for each input line, you will print to standard output (using
cout )
a line containing the
character-string,
the two numbers, and the sum of the two numbers.

the program will continue until the end of the input file.

unix supplies several library routines to make this assignment easier.
for example, to convert a ascii string to a number, you can use
atoi
or
atof
(pronounced,
"a to i",
ascii to integer, and
"a to f",
ascii to float).
use the "man"
command to look up the details.
to copy strings, you can use
strcpy;
to compare strings, you can use
strcmp.
do a
man string
to look up these routines.
command line parameters

unix and c++ make command line parameters easily available.
the main procedure in your program should look like:

	#include &lt;iostream.h>
	#include &lt;fstream.h>

	int
	main (int argc, char *argv[])
	{

	    cout 

the command line is processed (by the shell) into a list of character strings,
one for each argument (including the command name).
you can reference the integer
argc
to tell you the number of arguments.
the array
argv
is the list of strings.
so, if you typed in the command appearing at the beginning of this assignment,
argc would contain the value 2,
argv[0]
would contain the string "writer",
and
argv[1]
would contain the
string "filename".
deliverables

you should hand in a print-out of your program and output from your program
on the sample files that we will provide.
we will announce in class where to find these files.

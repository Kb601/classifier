paging, segmentation, and tlb's
consider a virtual memory architecture with the following parameters:


64 bit words

64 bit virtual addresses

8k byte page size

512k segments in a virtual address

4 gigabytes of real memory

page tables are stored in real memory

page tables can start on any byte boundary





add a tlb to the memory mapping architecture that is described above.
this cache should be
2-way set associative
and have
64 rows.


draw a diagram of the tlb based on the figure on the next page, showing the size of each field in the tlb.
indicate how bits of the va are used for input to the tlb, and describe the
outputs from the tlb.

how often do you need to flush (clear) the tlb?

on every context switch.

why?

tlb's contain mappings from virtual to physical addresses.
if you do not flush the tlb, then the current process may use the
mappings from the previous one, causing it to access the wrong page frames.

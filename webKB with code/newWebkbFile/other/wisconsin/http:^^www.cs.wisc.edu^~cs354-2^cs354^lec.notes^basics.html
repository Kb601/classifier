some introductory material
--------------------------


basic concept within computer science and engineering:
     levels of abstraction
     hierarchy
     models

     used (for our purposes) to design programs, computers

     when a problem is large, it needs to be broken down --
       we "divide and conquer"
       one way is by introducing a hierarchy (level), and solving
       the problem at each level
     example: design of a computer
       1. transistors available
       2. gates, flip flops
       3. components, like registers and adders
       4. cpu, memory system, i/o devices
       5. computer system
	  

			 | ------- cpu

   computer system ------| ------- memory

   components  gates  transistors





     top-down vs. bottom-up design




     another example:  software levels of abstraction
       writing a large program -- >10,000 lines of code
       top-down:
       divide into modules, design each module separately.
       define procedures (functions) that accomplish a task.
       specify interfaces (parameters) for the procedures.

       the implementation of a function is independent of
       its interface specification!  it is a different level
       in the abstraction of program design.


    the "big picture" -- a computer with software running on it.



      hll                                               computer
      pascal, c, fortran  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     hardware


    how do we get from one to the other?
		   wanted:  write in nice abstract hll.
		   have:  stupid computer that only knows how to
			  execute machine language

    what is machine language?
	binary sequences -- interpreted by computer as instructions.
	not very human readable.

    to help the situation, introduce assembly language --
	a more human readable form of machine language.
	uses mneumonics for the instruction type, and operands
	but, now we need something to translate assembly lang.
	     to machine lang.:  an assembler
   
    lastly, if we had a program that translated hll programs
	to assembly language, then we'd have it made.
	a compiler does this.




    complete picture:


             -----------                  ------------
    hll ---> | compiler|---> assembly --->| assembler|--->machine
             -----------     language     ------------    language




this course deals with the software aspects of assembly language,
   assemblers and machine language.  it also deals with the
   hardware aspects of what the computer does to execute programs.
   it is an introduction to study of computer architecture:
   the interface between hardware and software.



about computer architecture

   the relation between hardware (stuff you can touch)
		   and  software (programs, code)


   i can design a computer that has hardware which executes
   programs in any programming language.
     for example,  a computer that directly executes pascal.


   so, why don't we do just that?
   1.  from experience (in the engineering community), we know
   that the hardware that executes hll programs directly
   are slower than those that execute a more simple, basic
   set of instructions.

   2.  usability of the machine.  not everyone wants a pascal
   machine.  any high level language can be translated into
   assembly language.



in this class, in whatever language you are writing programs,
it will look like you have a machine that executes
those programs directly.

what we will do:



   hll --->    sal --->    mal  --->  tal


we assume that you know a hll.  from that, we can give you
sal.  later in the semester, you will learn mal and tal.


hll, sal, and mal are each abstractions.
each defines a computer architecture.
tal happens to be a real (manufactured) architecture.



basic computer operation

cpu -- controls the running of programs
       executes instructions
       makes requests of the memory
memory -- where programs and program variables are stored
	  handles requests from the cpu

     (stored program computer concept)

interaction between cpu and memory.
    to execute an instruction, the cpu must be able to
    request 3 things from memory:

    1. instruction                     fetch
    2. operand (variable) load         load
    3. operand (variable) store        store


    the memory really only needs to be able to do 2 operations

    1. read   (fetch or load)
    2. write  (store)


    where?       a label specifies a unique place in memory.
		 a label is often identified as an address.


    read:   cpu specifies an address and a read operation
	    memory responds with the contents of the address

    write:  cpu specifies an address, data to be stored, and
	    a write operation
	    memory responds by overwriting the data at the
	    address specified



for discussion:   how (most) computers operate wrt the execution
		  of instructions.


     discussion by a generic assembly language instruction example:
	    mult   a, b, c


     instructions and operands are stored in memory.
     before they can be used by the cpu, they must
     be fetched/loaded

     cpu steps involved:
       1. fetch the instruction
	  questions for later: which instruction, what address
       2. figure out what the instruction is -- decode
	  it is a mult instruction
	  this also reveals how many operands there are, since
	  the number of operands is fixed for any given instruction
	  there are 3 operands
       3. load operand(s)
          operands are b and c
       4. do the operation specified by the instruction
	  multiply b and c together
       5. store result(s) (if any)
	  result goes into variable a

     next step:
     suppose we want to execute multiple instructions, like
     a program

     except for branch instructions, execute instructions sequentially

     the cpu must keep track of which instruction is to be
     executed

     it does this by the use of an extra variable contained within
     and maintained by the cpu, called a program counter, or pc
     the contents of the variable is the address of the next
     instruction to be executed.


     modify the above cpu steps:
       1.  fetch the instruction at the address given by the pc

       added step.  modify the pc such that it contains the address of
	       the next instruction to execute

       2-5. the same as above


  the added step could come at any time after step 1.  it is convenient
  to think of it as step 2.

  this set of steps works fine for all instructions except
  branch instructions.  




  branch instructions:
       example:   beq x, y, label


  1. fetch instruction -- address given by pc
  2. update pc
  3. decode
     (its a beq instruction)
  4. fetch operands (x and y)
  5. compare operands (for equality)
  6. if equal, overwrite pc with address implied by 3rd operand (label)



the cpu steps involved:
     1. fetch the instruction
     2. update pc
     3. decode
     4. load operand(s)
     5. do the operation specified by the instruction
     6. store result(s) (if any)


notice that this series of steps gets repeated constantly --
to make the computer useful, all that is needed is a way
to give the pc an initial value (the first instruction of a program),
and to have a way of knowing when the program is done, so the
pc can be given the starting address of another program.


the cycle of steps is very important -- it forms the basis for
understanding how a computer operates.  the cycle of steps
is termed the instruction fetch/execute cycle.

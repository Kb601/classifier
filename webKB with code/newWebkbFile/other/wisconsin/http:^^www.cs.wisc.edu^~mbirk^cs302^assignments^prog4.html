 cs302 section 12
 ta: michael birk
  assigned:  tue 10/15/96
  due:  tue 10/22/96


 for this assignment, you will write a program that is capable
of drawing a variety of shapes.  the shapes supported by your program
include a square, a rectable, an isoscoles triangle, and a diamond.
each shape can be printed "solid" or "hollow" using any desired
character.

 your program should be menu-driven, so that the user is repeatedly
presented with a menu of their options - the various shapes to print,
and the current settings of the options (solid or hollow and printing
character).

 you should also check for invalid input.  if the user enters 
invalid input, you should display an error message and promt the user
to re-enter the information.

 note: in general, code "duplication" is bad - you don't want to
have identical or very similar code repeated throughout your program
if it isn't necessary.  instead, you should try writing one function
which does the job.  often it is necessary to generalize that function
by adding more parameters.  for this program, you don't
need separate hollow and solid printing functions for each of the
different shapes!  in addition, it is possible to put the
valid-input-checking code in one function and avoid duplicating it all
over the place.

 what to hand in 

 you should hand in your source code, and the program's output showing
all four shapes being printed in both solid and hollow mode.
the overall format of the output should be very similar to the sample output
below.

 notes and hints 


   your menu should display the current printing character
       and whether you are in hollow or solid mode.
   you must document all of the functions in your program with
       comments; this documentation should explain what the function does,
       what the meanings of the inputs and outputs are, and what side
       effects the function has.
   do not use any global variables in your program; all variables
       should be local to a function.  use function parameters to pass
       information into a function.
   for each shape, choose minimum and maximum values for the number
       of rows, width, etc.  use a loop to check that the value given by
       the user is in the correct range.
   the square is just a special case of the rectangle with the same
       width and height.

statistics for pages on www.cs.wisc.edu

 as of july 1995 users on the departmental computers can receive weekly
statistics outlining how many times their world wide web pages were accessed
and what other pages on the web contain links to theirs.

 to receive a statistics report, a file called ".statinfo" should
be created in your www directory 
(~username/public/html/).  (for projects that have their
own aliases in the server's configuration files, put the .statinfo
file in the directory pointed to by the alias.) this file should contain a list 
of addresses, one per line, to whom the statistics should be mailed.  this
is similar to a .forward file, except that the address must be a valid 
internet mailing address, not a program or file.  the statistics will be 
sent to each person on the list every friday night, shortly after midnight.

 the statistics file will look something like this:

the following is a list of relative world wide web urls for files 
accessed in the past week and located under the directory

/u/k/e/keeper/public/html

each url is followed on the same line by the number of hits it received 
in the past week.  if the information is available, an indented list of 
pages which contain links to the url appears below it.

 note that the list of references includes the links from your own
documents.  this is intentional.  also note that adding up the hits on
all the reference links will often yield a lower number than the total
hit count of a page.  this is because not all browsers send the 
url for the refering page (referring links are a new feature of the http 
protocol).  some referring pages may not contain links to the listed 
page.  this can happen if the maintainer of the referring page removes 
the link, or more commonly if a user chose "open" and entered the url for
your page while the referring page was loaded into their browser.

 please be careful not to overstate the importance of these numbers.
if you wish to measure the success of your pages, the number of pages
linking to it is probably a much better metric than the hit count.  
remember, you get the hit before a user has even read the page.

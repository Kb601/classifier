cs354, fall 1996

homework 1, due wednesday september 18 at the


(1) t/f, 10 points, 1 point each

note: the complete sal instruction set is given in
appendix a of the textbook, page 386.

(a) all variables in sal programs are global (t)

(b) the sal statement "get x" works the same for all types of "x"
(f)

(c) the label "b" could be used for a variable in a sal program
(f,  it's  a reserved word)

(d) variables must be declared before they are used in sal
programs (f, the ".data" section can come after the ".text"
section of the source code)

(e) when executed, the sal statement "b (ret)" will cause a branch
to the sal statement labeled by "ret:" (f,  in this context, ret
is a variable name, not a statement label)

(f) when executed, the sal statement "j ret" will cause a branch
to the sal statement labeled by "ret:" (t, here ret is a statement
label)

(g) every sal program must have a "__start:" label in it somewhere
(t)

(h) "done" is part of the sal instruction set (f, it's a
"macro")

(i) "rem" is used to put a remark or comment in a sal program
(f)

(j) type declarations are made in sal programs so that type
checking can be done by the assembler (f, type defs are to reserve
space only)

(2) 2 points

in a single sentence, explain what "computer architecture" means.



   in the context of cs354, "computer architecture" is defined
   by the basic instruction set of the computer.


3) 8 points

translate the following c code into the equivalent sal statements.
assume that all variables are of c type "int."

if ((a &gt; 0 ) || ( b == 1 )) {
     c = a + b * 5;
} else {
     a++; 
     b = ( a / b ) % c;
}

--------------------------------------------

      bgtz a, then    # if a &gt; 0, do 
then part
      beq  b, 1, then # or if b == 1, do then part
      add  a, a, 1    # else part ...
      div  b, a, b
      rem  b, b, c
      j    cont       # jump over then part
then: mul  c, b, 5    # then part
      add  c, a, c
-------------------------------------------------------------
	### another solution
         blez   a, check2
then:    mul    c, b, 5
         add    c, c, a
         b      cont
check2:  beq    b, 1, then
         add    a, a, 1
         div    b, a, b
         rem    b, b, c
-------------------------------------------------------------

ieee ras technical committee on robot motion 
and path planning 






    ieee ras tech. committee  
on robot motion & path planning      

   groups active in motion planning 
research    

 this is a partial list of people and organizations involved in
research on automatic motion planning. at this time, one name for
contact (noted by "c:") is given for each organization. the areas covered include
both theory and applications of motion planning methodology:
robotics, computational geometry, control systems, cad-cam design
etc.  those interested in adding, deleting, or correcting
information on this list, please send your messages to
        lumelsky@engr.wisc.edu.   
  in the future, we may want to provide more than just names and
addresses, so please add few words about your group: the name of the
group; your position; nature of work; any software that your group
can post so that people can try it; if available, a web link to a
page with more information. 

we expect this list to grow, both in volume and diversity of
information it provides. for example, one section to add is a
bulletin of events that are of interest to this group; those
interested in posting such information please send it to us. advices
on how we can make this page more effective are most welcome.

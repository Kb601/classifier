 introduction 


the purpose of these notes is to help 537 students learn enough about
java to do the course projects.
all of the students have experience programming in c++,
but practically none of whom have used java.

 what is java? 

before we turn to the details, it is worth considering why java
has created such a stir.
much of it has nothing to do with the language  per se 
but with the way it is intended to be used.

to understand this point, you have to know a little bit about
the world-wide web.
the web consists of a set of
 servers 
scattered around the internet,
each of which maintains a set of
 pages. 
each page has a ``name'' called a
 universal resource locator  (url)
that uniquely distinguishes it from any other page in the world.
the url starts with the name of the server.
for example, the url of this document,
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~cs537-1/java-tutorial.html,
says that it can be retrieved by using the hypertext transfer protocol
(http) to connect to server www.cs.wisc.edu and ask it for
the page it calls /~cs537-1/java-tutorial.html.

each page is written in a combination of text and formatting directives called
the
 hypertext markup language  (html).
a
 browser 
is a program that runs on a personal computer or workstation
that knows how to display html documents
( netscape navigator  is currently
the most popular browser by far, but microsoft and others are trying
to change that).
html is fairly simple.
for example, the directive &lt;p&gt; is used to start
a paragraph, and text is set in italics by surrounding it
with &lt;i&gt;
and  &lt;/i&gt;.
the most important directive precedes some text with
&lt;a name="url&gt;
and follows it with &lt;/a&gt;.
the browser underlines the text, and when the user clicks on it with
the mouse, the browser goes and gets the page named by the url and
displays it.
to see more examples of html, take a look at this document.
if you are using netscape navigator, select ``document source''
from the ``view'' pull-down menu at the top of the window.


no sooner had html caught on that people wanted to extend it.
directives were added to show text in different
colors
and
sizes,
or make it
blink.
a set of directives was added to display
tables and images
.

next came sound and movies.
the possibilities seemed endless.

there was one big problem, however:
if you created a document using a new feature, it couldn't be displayed
by a browser that didn't ``understand'' that feature.
thus for a feature to be useful, it had to be implemented by 
all (or at least a substantial fraction of) the millions
of browsers ``out there''.

then someone got a bright idea:
how about including with each document a program capable of displaying it?
the browser wouldn't have to ``understand'' the document.
it could just run the executable code that came with it, and that code
would know how to display the document.
unfortunately, this idea has two very serious problems.

the first problem is that browsers run on all sorts of computers,
running all sorts of operating systems.
if i include with my document a program designed to run on a sparcstation
under solaris, it will be useless on a pentium running windows 95.
the second program concerns security.
running programs from random untrusted sources on your own computer is
asking for trouble.
that's what viruses are all about.
instead of displaying the document, the program may clear your disk or
look for private information and send it back over
the network to a bad guy.

fortunately, there is another idea that solves both of these problems.
instead of including a machine-language program with a document,
send a program written for a
virtual machine
that is simulated by a software interpreter.
arrange to have each browser include an interpreter for the virtual machine.
in a sense, this just re-introduces the previous problem of requiring
a new feature to be implemented by everyone's browser, but only one
last time.
once you've convinced all the browser vendors to implement an interpreter
for the virtual machine,
they won't have to implement any more extensions.

the interpreter can also include security safeguards.
for example, if it doesn't implement any operation to open files,
you don't have to worry about a mischievous program stealing your data.
it is very difficult, if not impossible, to build such safeguards around
machine-language programs, because such programs can contain ``bugs''
that are actually devious tricks to circumvent security restrictions.
a subscript out of bounds may actually be an attempt
to read some data stored outside the memory space allocated to
the program.

the java language was specially designed as a ``cleaned up'' version
of c++ with these loopholes removed.
if you assign random garbage to a c++ pointer variable and then dereference
it, you will get whatever is stored in memory at that address.
for example, the following fetches whatever happens to be store at
location 1000 in memory:

    int *p = (int *)1000;
    int x = *p;

java prevents you from doing this sort of thing, whether accidentally
or on purpose, by a combination of strong type checking and runtime
checks.
a pointer variable is always initialized to null,
and you can only assign other pointer values (not integers or other
data) to it.
if you attempt to dereference a null pointer, you get a runtime exception.

because java was designed primarily to build active, multimedia, interactive
documents, its standard runtime library has lots of features to aid in
creating user interfaces.
there are standard classes to create scrollbars, pop-up menus, etc.
there are special facilities for manipulating url's and network
connections.
we will not be using any of these features.
on the other hand, there is one thing operating systems and user
interfaces have in common:
they both require multiple, cooperating threads of control.
we will be using these features in this course.

 applications vs applets 

the first thing you have to decide when writing a java program is
whether you are writing an
application or an applet.
an applet is piece of code designed to display a part of a document.
it is run by a browser in response to an html directive in the document.
we will not be writing any applets in this course.

an application is a stand-alone program.
all of our programs will be applications.

 a first example 

large parts of java are identical to c++.
for example, the following procedure, which sorts an array of integers
using insertion sort, is exactly the same in c++ or java.

/** sort the array a[] in ascending order using an insertion sort.  */
void sort(int a[], int size) {
    for (int i = 1; i &lt; size; i++) {
        // a[0..i-1] is sorted; insert a[i] in the proper place
        int x = a[i];
        int j;
        for (j = i-1; j &gt;=0; --j) {
            if (a[j] &lt;= x)
                break;
            a[j+1] = a[j];
        }
        // now a[0..j] are all &lt;= x and a[j+2..i] are &gt; x
        a[j+1] = x;
    }
}


note that the syntax of control structures (such as for
and if), assignment statements, variable declarations,
and comments are all the same in java as in c++.

to test this procedure in a c++ program, we might use a ``main program''
like this:

#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
extern &quot;c&quot; int random();

/** test program to test sort */
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;usage: sort array-size&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        exit(1);
    }
    int size = atoi(argv[1]);
    int *test = new int[size];
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
        test[i] = random() % 100;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;before&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
        cout &lt;&lt; test[i] &lt;&lt; endl;

    sort(test, size);

    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;after&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
        cout &lt;&lt; test[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}


a java program to test the sort procedure is different in a few ways.
here is a complete java program using the sort procedure.

import java.io.*;
import java.util.random;

class sorttest {
    /** sort the array a[] in ascending order using an insertion sort.  */
    static void sort(int a[], int size) {
        for (int i = 1; i &lt; size; i++) {
            // a[0..i-1] is sorted; insert a[i] in the proper place
            int x = a[i];
            int j;
            for (j = i-1; j &gt;=0; --j) {
                if (a[j] &lt;= x)
                    break;
                a[j+1] = a[j];
            }
            // now a[0..j] are all &lt;= x and a[j+2..i] are &gt; x
            a[j+1] = x;
        }
    }

    /** test program to test sort */
    public static void main(string argv[]) {
        if (argv.length != 1) {
            system.out.println(&quot;usage: sort array-size&quot;);
            system.exit(1);
        }
        int size = integer.parseint(argv[0]);
        int test[] = new int[size];
        random r = new random();

        system.out.println(&quot;&lt;&quot; + 4 * math.atan(1) + &quot;&gt;&quot;);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
            test[i] = (int)(r.nextfloat() * 100);
        system.out.println(&quot;before&quot;);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
            system.out.println(test[i]);

        sort(test, size);

        system.out.println(&quot;after&quot;);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
            system.out.println(test[i]);

        system.exit(0);
    }
}


a copy of this program is available in

~cs537-1/public/examples/sorttest.java.

to try it out, create a new directory and copy the example to a file
named sorttest.java in that directory.  (the file must
be called sorttest.java!)

    mkdir test1
    cd test1
    cp ~cs537-1/public/examples/sorttest.java sorttest.java
    javac sorttest.java
    java sorttest 10

(you can also grab a copy of the source with your net browser.
visit

~cs537-1/public/examples/sorttest.java

and use the save as... option from the file menu.)

the javac command invokes the java compiler on the source
file sorttest.java.
if all goes well, it will create a file named sorttest.class,
which contains code for the java virtual machine.
the java command invokes the java interpreter to run the code
for class sorttest.  note that the first parameter is
sorttest, not sorttest.class
or sorttest.java because it is the name of a class,
not a file.

there are several things to note about this program.
first, java has no ``top-level'' or ``global'' variables or functions.
a java program is always a set of class definitions.
thus, we had to make sort and main member functions
(called ``methods'' in java) of a class, which we called
sorttest.

second, the main function is handled somewhat differently in
java from c++.
in c++, the first function to be executed is always a function called
main, which has two arguments and return an integer value.
the return value is the ``exit status'' of the program; by convention,
a status of zero means ``normal termination'' and anything else means
something went wrong.
the first argument is the number of words on the command-line that invoked
the program, and the second argument is a an array of character strings
(denoted char *argv[] in c++) containing those words.
if we invoke the program by typing

    sort 10

we will find that
argc==2,
argv[0]=="sort", and
argv[1]=="10".

in java, the first thing executed is the method called main
of the indicated class (in this case sorttest).
the main method does not return any value (it is of type
void).
for now, ignore the words ``public static'' preceding
void.  we will return to these later.
the main method takes only one parameter, an array of strings
(denoted string argv[] in java).
this array will have one element for each word on the command line
following the name of the class being executed.
thus in our example call,

    java sorttest 10

argv[0] == "10".
there is no separate argument to tell you how many words there are,
but in java, you can tell how big any array is by using
length.
in this case argv.length == 1, meaning argv
contains only one word.

the third difference to note is the way i/o is done in java.
system.out in java is roughly equivalent to cout
in c++ (or stdout in c), and

    system.out.println(whatever);

is (even more) roughly equivalent to

    cout &lt;&lt; whatever &lt;&lt; endl;


our c++ program used three functions from the standard library,
atoi, random, and exit.
integer.parseint does the same thing as atoi:
it converts the character-string "10" to the integer value ten,
and system.exit(1) does the same thing as exit(1):
it immediately terminates the program, returning an exit status of 1
(meaning something's wrong).
the library class random defines random-number generators.
the statement random r = new random() create an instance of
this class, and r.nextfloat() uses it to generate a floating
point number between 0 and 1.
the cast (int) means the same thing in java as in c++.
it converts its floating-point argument to an integer, throwing away
the fraction.

finally, note that the #include directives from c++ have
been replaced by import declarations.
although they have roughly the same effect, the mechanisms are different.
in c++, #include &lt;iostream.h&gt; pulls in a source file
called iostream.h from a source library and compiles it along
with the rest of the program.
#include is usually used to include files containing declarations
of library functions and classes, but the file could contain any c++
source code whatever.
the java declaration import java.util.random brings in
the pre-compiled class random from a package called
java.util.  the declaration import java.io.*
bring in all of the classes defined in the package
java.util.  a package is sort of like a library.
you won't have to worry much about packages for this course.

 values, objects, and pointers 

it is sometimes said that java doesn't have pointers.
that is not true.
in fact, objects can only be referenced with pointers.
more precisely, variables can hold primitive values (such
as integers or floating-point numbers) or pointers
to objects.
a variable cannot hold an object, and you cannot make a pointer to
a primitive value.
since you don't have a choice, java doesn't have a special notation
like c++ does to indicate when you want to use a pointer.

there are exactly eight primitive types in java,
boolean,
char,
byte,
short,
int,
long,
float, and
double.
most of these are similar to types with the same name in c++.
we mention only the differences.

a boolean value is either
true or
false.
you cannot use an integer
where a boolean is required
(e.g. in an if or
while statement)
nor is there any automatic conversion between
boolean
and
integer.

a char value is 16 bits rather
than 8 bits, as it is in c or c++, to allow for all sorts of international
alphabets.
as a practical matter, however, you are unlikely to notice the difference.
the byte type is 8 bits.

a short is 16 bits and an
int is 32 bits, just as in c or
c++ on most modern machines (in c++ the size is machine-dependent, but
in java it's guaranteed).
a java long is not
the same as in c++ -- it is 64 bits long.
the types float
and double are just like in c++:
32-bit and 64-bit floating point.

as in c++, objects are instances of classes.
there is no prefix * or &amp; operator or
infix -&gt; operator.

as an example, consider the class declaration (which is the same in
c++ and in java)


class point { int x, y; }


c++java
point origin;point origin = new point();
point *p, *q, *r;point p, q, r;
origin.x = 0;origin.x = 0;
p = new point;p = new point();
p -> y = 5;p.y = 5;
q = p;q = p;
r = &origin;not possible


.


 garbage collection 

new objects are create by the new operator in java just like c++
(except that an argument list is required after the class name, even
if the constructor for the class doesn't take any arguments so the list
is empty).
however, there is no delete operator.
the java system automatically deletes objects when no references to them
remain.
this is a much more important convenience than it may at first seem.
delete operator is extremely error-prone.
deleting objects too early can lead to dangling reference, as in

    p = new point();
    // ...
    q = p;
    // ... much later
    delete p;
    q -&gt; x  = 5; // oops!

while deleting them too late (or not at all) can lead to garbage,
also known as a storage leak.

 static, final, public, and private 

just as in c++, it is possible to restrict access to members of a class
by declaring them private, but the syntax is different.

in c++:

    class c {
        private:
            int i;
            double d;
        public:
            int j;
            void f() { /*...*/ }
    }

in java:

    class c {
        private int i;
        public int j;
        private double d;
        public void f() { /* ... */ }
    }

as in c++, private members can only be accessed from inside the bodies
of methods (function members) of the class, not ``from the outside.''
thus if x is an instance of c, x.i is not legal,
but i can be accessed from the body of x.f().
(protected is also supported; it means the same thing as it does
in c++).
the default (if neither public nor private is specified)
is that a member can be accessed from anywhere in the same package,
giving a facility rather like ``friends'' in c++.
you will probably be putting all your classes in one package, so
the default is essentially public.

the keyword static also means the same thing in java as c++,
which not what the word implies:
ordinary members have one copy per instance, while static members
have only one copy, shared by instances.
in effect, a static member lives in the class itself, rather than
instances.

    class c {
        int x = 1;  // by the way, this isn't legal in c++
        static int y = 1;
        void f(int n) { x += n; }
        static int g() { return ++y; }
    }
    c p = new c();
    c q = new c();
    p.f(3);
    q.f(5);
    system.out.println(p.x);  // prints 4
    system.out.println(q.x);  // prints 6
    system.out.println(c.y);  // prints 1
    system.out.println(p.y);  // means the same thing
    system.out.println(c.g());// prints 2
    system.out.println(q.g());// prints 3

static members are often used instead of global variables and functions,
which do not exist in java.
for example,

    math.tan(x);  // tan is a static method of class math
    math.pi;      // a static &quot;field&quot; of class math
    integer.parseint(&quot;10&quot;); // used &lt;a href=&quot;#sort&quot;&gt;in the sorting example&lt;/a&gt;

the keyword final is roughly equivalent to const in c++:
final fields cannot be changed.
it is often used in conjunction with static to defined named constants.

    class card {
        int suit = clubs;     // default
        final static int clubs = 1;
        final static int diamonds = 2;
        final static int hearts = 3;
        final static int spades = 4;
    }
    card c = new card();
    c.suit = card.spades;

each card has its own suit.
the value clubs is shared by all instances of card so
it only needs to be stored once, but since it's final, it doesn't
need to be stored at all!

 arrays 

in java, arrays are objects.
like all objects in java, you can only point to them, but unlike a c++
variable, which is treated like a pointer to the first element
of the array, a java array variable points to the array object.
there is no way to point to a particular member of an array.

each array has a read-only (final) field length that tells you how
many elements it has.  the elements are numbered starting at zero as in c++:
a[0] ... a[a.length-1].
once you create an array (using new), you can't change its size.
if you need more space, you have to create a new (larger) array and copy
over the elements (but see the library class

vector
below).

    int x = 3;   // a value 
    int a[];     // a pointer to an array object; initially null
    int[] a;     // means exactly the same thing
    a = new int[10]; // now a points to an array object
    a[3] = 17;   // accesses one of the slots in the array
    a = new int[5]; // assigns a different array to a
                 // the old array is inaccessible (and so
                 // is garbage-collected)
    int[] b = a; // a and b share the same array object
    system.out.println(a.length); // prints 5


.


 strings 

since you can make an array of anything, you can make an an array of
char or an an array of byte, but java has something much better:
the type string.
the + operator is overloaded on strings to mean
concatenation.  what's more, you can concatenate anything with
a string; java automatically converts it to a string.
built-in types such as numbers are converted in the obvious way.
objects are converted by calling their tostring() methods.
library classes all have tostring methods that do something reasonable.
you can do likewise for classes you define.
this is great for debugging.

    string s = &quot;hello&quot;;
    string t = &quot;world&quot;;
    system.out.println(s + &quot;, &quot; + t);       // prints &quot;hello, world&quot;
    system.out.println(s + &quot;1234&quot;);         // &quot;hello1234&quot;
    system.out.println(s + (12*100 + 34));  // &quot;hello1234&quot;
    system.out.println(s + 12*100 + 34);    // &quot;hello120034&quot; (why?)
    system.out.println(&quot;the value of x is &quot; + x);  // will work for any x
    system.out.println(&quot;system.out = &quot; + system.out);
                // &quot;system.out = java.io.printstream@80455198&quot;
    string numbers = &quot;&quot;;
    for (int i=0; i&lt;5; i++)
        numbers += &quot; &quot; + i;
    system.out.println(numbers);            // &quot; 1 2 3 4 5&quot;

strings have lots of other useful operations:

    string s = &quot;whatever&quot;, t = &quot;whatnow&quot;;
    s.charat(0);            // 'w'
    s.charat(3);            // 't'
    t.substring(4);         // &quot;now&quot;
    t.substring(4,6);       // &quot;no&quot;
    s.substring(0,4);       // &quot;what&quot;
    t.substring(0,4);       // &quot;what&quot;
    s.compareto(t);         // a value less than zero (s precedes t in &quot;lexicographic&quot;
                            // (dictionary) order
    t.compareto(s);         // a value greater than zero (t follows s)
    t.compareto(&quot;whatnow&quot;); // zero
    t.substring(0,4) == s.substring(0,4);
                            // false (they are different string objects)
    t.substring(0,4).equals(s.substring(0,4));
                            // true (but they are both equal to &quot;what&quot;)
    t.indexof('w');         // 0
    t.indexof('t');         // 3
    t.indexof(&quot;now&quot;);       // 4
    t.lastindexof('w');     // 6
    t.endswith(&quot;now&quot;);      // true

and more.

you can't modify a string, but you can make a string variable point to
a new string (as in numbers += " " + i;).  see stringbuffer if
you want a string you can scribble on.

 constructors and overloading 

a constructor is like in c++: a method with the same name as the class.
if a constructor has arguments, you supply corresponding values when using
new.  even if it has no arguments, you still need the parentheses
(unlike c++).
there can be multiple constructors, with different numbers or types of
arguments.  the same is true for other methods.  this is called
overloading.  unlike c++, you cannot overload operators.
the operator `+' is overloaded for strings and (various kinds of) numbers,
but user-defined overloading is not allowed.

    class point {
        int x, y;
        point(int u, int v) {
            x = u;  // the same as this.x = u
            y = v;
        }
        point(int x) {
            this.x = x;  // not the same as x = x!
            y = 0;
        }
        point() {
            x = 0;
            y = 0;
        }
    }
    class test {
        public static void main(string[] argv) {
            point p1 = new point(3,4);
            point p2 = new point();  // same as new point(0,0)
            point p3 = new point;    // error!
        }
    }

nb:  the bodies of the methods have to be defined
in line right after their headers as shown above.  you have to
write

    class foo {
        double square(double d) { return d*d; }
    };

rather than

    class foo {
        double square(double);
    };
    double foo::square(double d) { return d*d; }
        // ok in c++ but not in java

        
 inheritance, interfaces, and casts 

in c++, when we write

    class derived : public base { ... }

we mean two things:

 a derived can do anything a base can, and perhaps more.
 a derived does things the way a base does them,
unless specified otherwise.

the first of these is called interface inheritance or
subtyping and the second
is called method inheritance.
in java, they are specified differently.

method inheritance is specified with the keyword extends.

    class base {
        int f() { /* ... */ }
        void g(int x) { /* ... */ }
    }
    class derived extends base {
        void g(int x) { /* ... */ }
        double h() { /* ... */ }
    }

class derived has three methods: f, g, and h.  the
method derived.f() is implemented in the same way (the same executable
code) as base.f(), but derived.g() overrides the
implementation of base.g().
we call base the super class of derived and
derived a subclass of base.
every class (with one exception) has exactly one super class (single
inheritance).  if you leave out the extends specification, java
treats it like ``extends object''.
the primordial class
object is the lone exception -- it does not extend anything.  all other 
classes extend object either directly or indirectly.
object has a method tostring, so every class has a method
tostring; either it inherits the method from its super class
or it overrides it.

interface inheritance is specified with implements.
a class implements an interface, which is like a class, except that
the methods don't have bodies.
two examples are given by the built-in interfaces

runnable

and
datainput.

    interface runnable {
        public void run();
    }
    interface enumeration {
        public boolean hasmoreelements();
        public object nextelement();
    }

an object is runnable if it has a method named run that
is public and has no arguments or results.
to be an enumeration, it has to have a public member
hasmoreelements
that returns a boolean and a public member nextelement that
returns an object.
a class that claims to implement these interfaces has to either
inherit them (via extends) or define them itself.

    class words extends stringtokenizer implements enumeration, runnable {
        public void run() {
            for (;;) {
                string s = nexttoken();
                if (s == null) return;
                system.out.println(s);
            }
        }
        words(string s) {
            super(s);
            // perhaps do something else with s as well
        }
    }

the class words needs methods run, hasmoreelements, and
nextelement to meet its promise to implement interfaces
runnable and enumeration.
it inherits implementations of hasmoreelements and
nextelement from

stringtokenizer 
, but it has to give its own implementation of run.
the implements clause tells users of the class what they can
expect from it.
if w is an instance of words, i know i can write
w.run(); or if (w.hasmoreelements()) then ....
a class can only extend one class, but it can implement any number of
interfaces.

by the way, constructors are not inherited.
the call super(s) in class words calls the constructor of
stringtokenizer that takes one string argument.
if you don't explicitly call super, java automatically calls
the super class constructor with no arguments (such a constructor
must exist in this case).
note the call nexttoken() in words.run, which is short for
this.nexttoken().  since this is an instance of words,
it has a nexttoken method -- the one it inherited from
stringtokenizer.

a cast in java looks just like a cast in c++:  it is a type
name in parentheses preceding an expression.
we have

already seen

an example of a cast used to convert between primitive types.
a cast can also be used to convert an object reference to a super class
or subclass.
for example,

    words w = new words(&quot;this is a test&quot;);
    object o = w.nextelement();
    string s = (string)o;
    system.out.println(&quot;the first word has length &quot; + s.length());

we know that w.nextelement() is ok, since words implements
the interface enumeration, but all that tells us is that the value
returned has type object.
we cannot call o.length() because class object does not
have a length method.
in this case, however, we know that o is not just any kind of
object, but a string in particular.
thus we cast o to type string.
if we were wrong about the type of o we would get a run-time error.
if you are not sure of the type of an object, you can test it
with instanceof (note the lower case `o'), or find out more
about it with the method object.getclass()

    if (o instanceof string)
        n = ((string)o).length();
    else
        system.err.println(&quot;bad type &quot; + o.getclass().getname());


 exceptions 

a java program should never ``core dump,'' no matter how buggy it is.
if the compiler excepts it and something goes wrong at run time, java
throws an exception.
by default, an exception causes the program to terminate with an error
message, but you can also catch an exception.

    try {
        // ...
        foo.bar();
        // ...
        a[i] = 17;
        // ...
    }
    catch (indexoutofboundsexception e) {
        system.err.println(&quot;oops: &quot; + e);
    }

the try statement says you're interested in catching exceptions.
the catch clause (which can only appear after a try) says what to
do if an indexoutofboundsexception occurs anywhere in the
try clause.
in this case, we print an error message.
the tostring() method of an exception generates a string containing
information about what went wrong, as well as a call trace.
because we caught this exception, it will not terminate the program.
if some other kind of exception occurs (such as divide by zero),
the exception will be thrown back to the caller of this function and
if that function doesn't catch it, it will be thrown to that function's
caller, and
so on back to the main function, where it will terminate the
program if it isn't caught.
similarly, if the function foo.bar throws an
indexoutofboundsexception and doesn't catch it, we will catch it here.

the catch clause actually catches indexoutofboundsexception
or any of its subclasses, including arrayindexoutofboundsexception,
stringindexoutofboundsexception, and others.
an exception is just another kind of object, and the same rules
for inheritance hold for exceptions as any
other king of class.

you can define and throw your own exceptions.

    class sytaxerror extends exception {
        int linenumber;
        sytaxerror(string reason, int line) {
            super(reason);
            linenumber = line;
        }
        public string tostring() {
            return &quot;syntax error on line &quot; + linenumber + &quot;: &quot; + getmessage();
        }
    }
    class someotherclass {
        public void parse(string line) throws syntaxerror {
            // ...
            if (...)
                throw new syntaxerror(&quot;missing comma&quot;, currentline);
            //...
        }
        public void parsefile(string fname) {
            //...
            try {
                // ...
                nextline = in.readline();
                parse(nextline);
                // ...
            }
            catch (syntaxerror e) {
                system.err.println(&quot;&quot; + e);
            }
        }
    }

each function must declare in its header (with the keyword throws)
all the exceptions that may be thrown by it or any function it calls.
it doesn't have to declare exceptions it catches.
some exceptions, such as indexoutofboundsexception, are so common that
java makes an exception for them
(sorry about that) and doesn't require that they be declared.
this rule applies to runtimeexception and its subclasses.
you should never define new subclasses of runtimeexception.

there can be several catch clauses at the end of a try
statement, to catch various kinds of exceptions.
the first one that ``matches'' the exception (i.e., is a super class of it)
is executed.
you can also add a finally clause, which will always
be executed, no matter how the program leaves the try clause
(whether by falling through the bottom, executing a return,
break, or continue, or throwing an exception).

 threads 

java lets you do several things at once by using threads.
if your computer has more than one cpu, it may actually run two or more threads
simultaneously.
otherwise, it will switch back and forth among the threads at times that
are unpredictable unless you take special precautions to control it.

there are two different ways to create threads.  i will only describe
one of them here.

    thread t = new thread(cmd); // 
    t.start();  // t start running cmd, but we don't wait for it to finish
    // ... do something else (perhaps start other threads?)
    // ... later:
    t.join();  // wait for t to finish running cmd

the constructor for the built-in class thread takes one argument, which
is any object that has a method called run.
this requirment is specified by requiring
that command implement the
runnable  interface described earlier.
the way a thread ``runs'' a command is simply by calling its run()
method.
it's as simple as that!

in project 1, you are supposed to run each
command in a separate thread.
thus you might declare something like this:

    class command implements runnable {
        string thecommand;
        command(string c) {
            thecommand = c;
        }
        public void run() {
            // do what the command says to do
        }
    }

you can parse the command string either in the constructor or at
the start of the run() method.

the main program loop reads a command line, breaks it up into commands,
runs all of the commands concurrently (each in a separate thread),
and waits for them to all finish before issuing the next prompt.
in outline, it may look like this.

    for (;;) {
        system.out.print(&quot;% &quot;); system.out.flush();
        string line = inputstream.readline();
        int numberofcommands = // count how many comands there are on the line
        thread t[] = new thread[numberofcommands];
        for (int i=0; i&lt;numberofcommands; i++) {
            string c = // next command on the line
            t[i] = new thread(new command(c));
            t[i].start();
        }
        for (int i=0; i&lt;numberofcommands; i++) {
            t[i].join();
        }
    }

this main loop is in the main() method of your main class.
it is not necessary for that class to implement runnable.

although you won't need it for 
project 1, the next project will require
to to synchronize thread with each other.
there are two reasons why you need to do this:
to prevent threads from interferring with each other, and to allow
them to cooperate.
you use synchronized methods to prevent interference, and
the built-in methods
object.wait(),
object.notify(),
object.notifyall(), and
thread.yield()
to support cooperation.

any method can be preceded by the word synchronized (as
well as public, static, etc.).
the rule is:



no two threads may be executing synchronized methods of the
same object at the same time.



the java system enforces this rule by associating a monitor lock
with each object.
when a thread calls a synchronized method of an object,
it tries to grab the object's monitor lock.
if another thread is holding the lock, it waits until that thread
releases it.
a thread releases the monitor lock when it leaves the synchronized
method.
if one synchronized method of a calls contains a call to another,
a thread may have the same lock ``multiple times.''  java keeps track
of that correctly.  for example,

    class c {
        public synchronized void f() {
            // ...
            g();
            // ...
        }
        public synchronized void g() { /* ... */ }
    }

if a thread calls c.g() ``from the outside'', it grabs the
lock before executing the body of g() and releases it when done.
if it calls c.f(), it grabs the lock on entry to f(),
calls g() without waiting, and only releases the lock
on returning from f().

sometimes a thread needs to wait for another thread to do something
before it can continue.
the methods wait() and notify(), which are defined in class
object and thus inherited by all classes, are made for this purpose.
they can only be called from within synchronized methods.
a call to wait() releases the monitor lock and puts the calling thread
to sleep (i.e., it stops running).
a subsequent call to notify on the same object wakes up the thread
that has been sleeping the longest time and lets it start running again.
if no thread is sleeping in this object, notify() does nothing.
the awakened thread has to wait for the monitor lock before it starts, but it
has precedence over any other thread trying to enter a synchronized
method ``from the outside''.
the method notifyall is similar, but wakes up all threads
sleeping in the object.

    class buffer {
        private queue q;
        public synchronized void put(object o) {
            q.enqueue(o);
            notify();
        }
        public synchronized object get() {
            while (q.isempty())
                wait();
            return q.dequeue();
        }
    }

this class solves the so-call ``producer-consumer'' problem (it assumes
the queue class has been defined elsewhere).
``producer'' threads somehow create objects and put them into the buffer by
calling buffer.put(), while ``consumer'' threads remove objects from
the buffer (using buffer.get()) and do something with them.
the problem is that a consumer thread may call buffer.get() only
to discover that the queue is empty.
by calling wait() it releases the monitor lock so that producer threads
can call put() to add more objects, but it keeps its place in line
so it will get an object before other consumer threads that arrive later.
each time a producer adds an object, it calls notify() just in
case there is some consumer waiting for the object.

this example is not correct as it stands (and the java compiler will reject
it).
the wait() method can throw an interruptedexception
exception, so the get() method must either catch it or declare
that it throws interruptedexception as well.
the simplest solution is just to catch the exception and ignore it:

    class buffer {
        private queue q;
        public synchronized void put(object o) {
            q.enqueue(o);
            notify();
        }
        public synchronized object get() {
            while (q.isempty()) {
                try { wait(); }
                catch (interruptedexception e) {}
            }
            return q.dequeue();
        }
    }

there is also a version of object.wait() that takes an integer
parameter.
the call
wait(n) will return after n milliseconds if nobody wakes
up the thread with notify or notifyall sooner.

you may wonder why object.get() uses while (q.isempty())
rather than if (q.isempty()).
in this particular case, either would work.
however, in more complicated situations, a sleeping thread might be
awakened for the ``wrong'' reason.  thus it is always a good idea
when you wake up to recheck the condition that made to decide to go
to sleep before you continue.

 input and output 

input/output, as described in chapter 11 of the java book, is
not as complicated as it looks.
you can get pretty far just writing to system.out (which is of
type printstream) with methods println and print.
for input, you probably want to wrap the standard input system.in
in a datainputstream, which provides the handy method
readline()

    datainputstream in = new datainputstream(system.in);
    for (;;) {
        string line = in.readline();
        if (line == null)
            break;
        // do something with the next line
    }

datainputstream has lots of other methods, but they probably
don't do what you expect.
for example datainputstream.readint() reads four bytes of
raw data and concatenates them to form a binary integer.
if the next four bytes of input are the ascii characters "1234",
readint() will return 825373492.

if you want to read from a file, rather than from the keyboard (standard
input), you can use fileinputstream, probably wrapped in
a datainputstream.

    fileinputstream rawinput = new fileinputstream(&quot;somefile&quot;);
    datainputstream in = new datainputstream(rawinput);
    for (;;) {
        string line = in.readline();
        if (line == null)
            break;
        // do something with the next line
    }

similarly, you can use
new printstream(new fileoutputstream(filename))
to write to a file.

 other goodies 

the library of pre-defined classes has several other handy tools.
see

the online manual
 for more details.
integer, character, etc.
java makes a big distinction between values (integers, characters, etc.)
and objects.
sometimes you need an object when you have a value.
the classes integer, character, etc. serve as
convenient wrappers for this purpose.
for example, integer i = new integer(3) creates a version of
the number 3 wrapped up as an object.
the value can be retrieved as i.intvalue.
these classes also serve as convenient places to define utility functions
for manipulating value of the given types, often as static methods
or defined constants.

    integer.max_value           // 2147483648, the largest possible int
    integer.parseint(&quot;123&quot;)     // the int value 123
    integer.tohexstring(123)    // &quot;7b&quot;, 123 in hex
    new double(&quot;123e-2&quot;).doublevalue() // the double value 1.23
                                // see also page 150 of the java book
    character.isdigit('3')      // true
    character.isuppercase('a')  // false
    character.touppercase('a')  // 'a'

vector

a vector is like an array, but it grows as necessary to allow
you to add as many elements as you like.
unfortunately, there is only one kind of vector--a vector of
object.  thus you can insert objects of any type into it,
but when you take objects out, you have to use a cast to recover the
original type.

    vector v = new vector();     // an empty vector
    for (int i=0; i&lt;100; i++)
        v.addelement(new integer(i));
    // now it contains 100 integer objects

    // print their squares
    for (int i=0; i&lt;100; i++) {
        integer n = (integer)(v.elementat(i));
        int n = n.intvalue();
        system.out.println(n*n);
    }
    v.setelementat(&quot;hello&quot;, 5);  // like v[5] = &quot;hello&quot;
    object o = v.elementat(3);   // like o = v[3];
    v.insertelement(&quot;world&quot;, 6); // set v[6] = &quot;world&quot; after first shifting
                                 // element v[7], v[8], ... to the right to make room
    v.removeelementat(3);        // remove v[3] and shift v[4], ... to the
                                 // left to fill in the gap

the class vector is implemented using an ordinary array that is
generally only partially filled.
if vector runs out of space, it allocates a bigger array and copies over
the elements.
there are a variety of additional methods, not shown here, that
let you give the implementation advice on how to manage the extra space
more efficiently.
for example, if you know that you are not gonig to add any more elements to
v, you can call v.trimtosize() to tell the system to 
repack the elements into an array just big enough to hold them.

don't forget to import java.util.vector;  (or 
import java.util.*; ) if you are using vectors.
hashtable

a hashtable implements a mapping from objects called ``keys'' to
objects called ``values.''

    hashtable h = new hashtable();    // an empty table
    h.put(&quot;seven&quot;, new integer(7));   // key is the string &quot;seven&quot;;
                                      // value is an integer object
    object o = h.put(&quot;seven&quot;, new double(7.0));
                                      // binds &quot;seven&quot; to a double object
                                      // and returns the previous value
    int n = ((integer)o).intvalue();  // n = 7
    h.containskey(&quot;seven&quot;)            // true
    h.containskey(&quot;twelve&quot;)           // false
    o = h.get(&quot;seven&quot;);               // get current binding (a double)
    o = h.remove(&quot;seven&quot;);            // get current binding and remove it
    h.clear();                        // remove all bindings


stringtokenizer

a stringtokenizer is handy in breaking up a string into words
separated by white space (or other separator characters).
the following example is from the java book:

    string str = &quot;gone, and forgotten&quot;;
    stringtokenizer tokens = new stringtokenizer(str, &quot; ,&quot;);
    while (tokens.hasmoretokens())
        system.out.println(tokens.nexttoken());

it prints out

    gone
    and
    forgotten

the second arguement to the constructor is a string containing the
characters that such be considered separators (in this case, space and
comma).  if it is omitted, it defaults to space, tab, return, and newline
(the most common ``white-space'' characters).

there is a much more complicated class streamtokenizer
for breaking up an
input stream into tokens.
many of its features seem to be designed to aid in parsing the java
langauge itself (which is not a surprise, considering that the java
compiler is written in java).
other utilities

the random-number generator random was presented
above.
see chapter 12 of the java book for information about other handy
classes.

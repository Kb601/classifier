university of wisconsin computer vision group 








the university of wisconsin - madison computer vision group
is conducting research in designing, implementing and experimenting
with important components of computer vision systems.  this includes
modules for image analysis and scene understanding
in the areas of

 visual exploration of objects by purposive viewpoint control
 motion analysis (periodic motion detection, dynamic perceptual
organization)
 three-dimensional shape representation and recognition, especially
     image-based representations
 deformable contours


in addition,
we are studying methods for using vision, images and image streams
for specific image-guided activities
in the areas of

 robotics: vision for 3d motion planning in unknown environments
 visualization: 
visualizing user-defined data types for interactively steering and
visual experimentation during algorithm development

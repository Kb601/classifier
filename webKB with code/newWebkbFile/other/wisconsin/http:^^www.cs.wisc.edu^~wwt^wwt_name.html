we refine our parallel supercomputer design ideas
with an execution-driven simulation system
called the 
wisconsin wind tunnel.  it runs a parallel shared-memory
program on a parallel computer (thinking machines cm-5) and uses
execution-driven, distributed, discrete-event simulation to accurately
calculate program execution time.  

the project is gets its name from tools--such as the wisconsin wind
tunnel--that allow us to cull the design space of parallel
supercomputers in a manner similar to how aeronautical engineers use
conventional wind tunnels to design airplanes.

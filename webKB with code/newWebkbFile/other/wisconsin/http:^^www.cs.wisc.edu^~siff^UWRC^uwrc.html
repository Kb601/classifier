the uw running club





the uw running club: run for fun 



the university of wisconsin at madison's running club offers a unique blend
of exercise and fun. runners are welcome at any level. while some members
are quite good at the competitive level, most of us run for enjoyment and to
stay healthy. joining the uw running club is a great way to meet other
runners, learn about running, and learn more about madison. on the running
side we work out together twice a week, organize teams for local (and
occasionally) not-so-local races, and put on two running events each
year. on the social side we eat, drink, and perform the one-and-only
running christmas carol. 

fall workouts: 

   wednesdays, 6:00pm, meet at mcclimon track for an interval
workout. starting wednesday, october 23, we will meet at camp randall
sports center (the shell) at 6:00.
   sundays, 10:00am, meet at camp randall sports center for distance
run. we run a short course (maybe 4 miles) and a longer route (maybe 10
miles).

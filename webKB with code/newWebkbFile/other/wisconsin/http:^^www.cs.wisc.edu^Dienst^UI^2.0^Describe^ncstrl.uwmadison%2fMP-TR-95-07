 this paper gives an extensive documentation of applications of finite-dimensional nonlinear complementarity problems in engineering and equilibrium modeling. for most applications, we describe the problem briefly, state the defining equations of the model, and give functional expressions for the complementarity formulations. the goal of this documentation is threefold: (i) to summarize the essential applications of the nonlinear complementarity problem known to date, (ii) to provide a basis for the continued research on the nonlinear complementarity problem, and (iii) to supply a broad collection of realistic complementarity problems for use in algorithmic experimentation and other studies.

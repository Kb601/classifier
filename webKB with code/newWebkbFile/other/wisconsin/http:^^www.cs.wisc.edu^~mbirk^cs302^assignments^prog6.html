for this assignment, you will write a program that can create
"mad libs."  a "mad lib" is a humorous story generated by taking
otherwise normal paragraphs and substituting arbitrary words and
phrases.



mad libs are probably best illustrated with an example.  here is
a sample run of the mad libs program:




enter a mad libs file: test.mad

enter a number: 1127
enter an adjective: slimy
enter a person's name: joe blow
enter an adjective: drunk
enter a verb: incinerate
enter an adjective: tranquil

computer science 1127 is a very slimy class.  the
reason is that our teacher, joe blow, is really
drunk.  one time, he even stopped right in the middle
of class to incinerate a student!  it wus truly a tranquil
experience.




the actual stories that will be processed by the mad libs program
are stored in a separate text file.  these mad libs files contain
the prompts for each word or phrase to be substituted.  for example,
the mad libs file, test.mad, used in the above example
looks like this:




computer science [a number] is a very [an adjective] class.  the
reason is that our teacher, [a person's name], is really
[an adjective].  one time, he even stopped right in the middle
of class to [a verb] a student!  it was truly a [an adjective]
experience!




notice how the prompts are surrounded with square brackets.  your
program should read the file (you can use the read_file
function from program 5), prompt the user for each of the words
or phrases to substitute into the story, and then print out the
story with the user's responses in place of the square-bracketed
prompts.

 hints and notes 

probably the simplest way to do this is to scan the mad libs file in two
passes.  the first time through, just extract each prompt, ask the user for
their response, and store the response in an array.  then go through the
text of the mad libs file a second time, this time printing out the story,
substituting the user's responses for the square-bracketed prompts.



recall that you can use the substring member function
of the string class to extract portions of a string (e.g., to
extract the prompts inside the square brackets.)  for example,




   string x = "abcde";
   cout &lt;&lt; x.substring (1,2); // prints "bc" - the string of 2 characters
                              // starting at position 1




note: you do not have to worry about somehow "reformatting"
the paragraph so all the lines have the same length.  just print the
story as it is given in the file, substituting the user prompts
with the user responses.


 what to hand in 


as usual, you will hand in the source code, along with the output
generated for some test cases.  these test cases are now available.
(note: they are also available "directly" in the lab, as
r:\public\mbirk\madlib1.txt and
r:\public\mbirk\madlib2.txt.)




   test 1
   test 2




feel free to hand in any of the creative madlibs that you came up
with on your own!  (but this is not required - only test cases 1 and 2
must be handed in.)

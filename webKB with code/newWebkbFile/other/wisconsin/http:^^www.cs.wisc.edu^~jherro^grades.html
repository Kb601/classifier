sorry it took me longer than i thought to grade the midterms.     
it was out of 89 points.  the average for my classes was 63.7/89. 
this comes out to about 71.6%. from what i've heard its consistent with 
the other labs. i wrote in your score out of 89. so to get your percentage 
score divide by 89. if you have any questions or complaints e-mail me!!  

the grades aren't in any particular order so you'll just have to look through
the list to find the last 4 digits of your student id.
if you are in one of my labs and aren't on either of these lists e-mail me at 
jherro@cs.wisc.edu.  everyone should 
be there now.  if you notice any other mistakes with 
the grades please let me know.  
lab1a and b were each worth 50 points. they were both all or nothing. so if i 
didn't get e-mail from you then you got 0. 
lab 2 was out of 100 
the lab on www was all or nothing. i don't know how much it will count so i 
just put an "x" if i recieved mail from you. 
lab3a and b were both out of 100. 
lab4a was out of 100. 
lab4b was out of 110

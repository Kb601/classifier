1.0  abstract

u-net is high-bandwidth, low-latency network communication protocol that can deliver 
parallel-computing horsepower to a network of pcs.  in this case, the pcs are 
connected via a fast ethernet switch.  in its original implementation, 
computers connected through u-net communicated through a simple 
communication scheme.  the u-net packet filter acts as an extension to the 
original implementation, giving u-net the capability to communicate 
using open standards.


2.0  overview

the job of the u-net packet filter (upf) is to demultiplex in-coming 
packets to their corresponding u-net endpoint destinations.  it is designed to 
demultiplex both connection-oriented and connection-less packets,	 
depending on the protocol/field combinations.  	

in the case of connection-oriented packets, a channel specifies an endpoint-
to-endpoint connection (i.e. a connection from one process to another).  if 
process a connects to process b, then a can only communicate with b, and 
b can only communicate with a on that channel.  if a wants to communicate 
with c, then it must open a separate channel.

in the case of connection-less packets, program a can open a broadcast or 
multicast channel.  any other process listening on that channel can receive 
packets sent from a.


3.0  design goals

the u-net packet filter was designed with two goals in mind:

above all, it has to be fast.  the ability to communicate over open 
standards is useless to u-net if it can do so only at normal network data-
rates.

the packet filter's topology has to be simplistic, and easily expandable.  
new filters cannot been written in pseudo-assembly and interpreted.  new 
filters must programmed into the existing system, however, the packet filter's 
simplistic structure allows for a certain degree of creativity on the part of the 
programmer, thereby easing the task of the programming itself.


the subsequent sections in this document discuss in detail the different 
components and structure of the u-net packet filter, with an eye towards 
demonstrating that the design goals have been met.


4.0  implementation

the current implementation, as of the date of this document, allows for 4 
distinct filter types.  they are, raw u-net (the simple communication 
scheme utilized by the original version of u-net), raw ethernet (u-net 
purely at the data-link layer), tcp/ip, and udp/ip.  


4.1  elementary components

the u-net packet filter is a directed a-cyclic graph (dag).  
it is made up of two basic components:


the cell:  this is a data-structure that contains twelve 32-bit word entries.  
this is the packet's most basic structure.  the cell is used for storing channel 
information (such as a channel's field values, such as port numbers and 
addresses), and it is used as a pointer to other cells and hash table. cells can 
be chained together to form doubly-linked lists.  for complete details and 
usage information on cells in upf, click here.

the hash table:  provided with a hashing function, these tables are used 
to spread out u-net channels over a range of hash_size.  each table 
contains hash_size pointers to cells.  these cells, as already 
mentioned, can be chained together in a linked-list.  the combination of cells 
and hash-tables creates a hashing data-structure with chaining, which is the 
way in which hash tables are utilized in the current implementation of upf.  




figure 1:  elemantary upf components



together, cells and hash tables are connected together to form a directed a-
cyclic graph (dag).  when a packet comes in off of the ethernet wire, each 
protocol in the composite packet header is broken down into fields.  these 
fields are then compared to information stored in the cells.  as matches are 
found, we follow the appropriate path through the dag.  

the next section breaks down the current architecture of the u-net packet 
filter, and discusses the protocols it currently supports.




4.2  protocol hierarchy in the u-net packet filter dag

the current implementation supports 4 protocols, two of which are open 
standards.  the following protocols are broken down has follows:


raw u-net:  the modified version of u-net (devtulip.c) is backwards 
compatible with the original implementation of u-net.  that is, packets can 
be demultiplexed to raw u-net channels based on the following fields:

u-net code
u-net port number




figure 2:  raw u-net ethernet header



these types of channels are not part of the upf system.  in the event that a 
raw u-net channel is detected, the upf system is by-passed, and the packet 
is demultiplexed based strictly on the u-net port number.  if the ethernet card is 
running in promiscuous or multicast mode, then only the u-net type and u-
net-port identify an endpoint/channel.  these channels are not 
guaranteed to be unique.



raw ethernet:  this protocol is similar to the raw u-net protocol, in that 
it is strictly a data-link layer protocol.  packets are demultiplexed to their 
corresponding endpoint/channel based on the following fields:


ethernet source (addr)
raw ethernet type



figure 3:  raw ethernet header



the combination of these two fields uniquely specify an endpoint (unless 
the source addr is an ethernet multicast or broadcast address).  the ethernet 
type can be any 16-bit value, provided that it is not a reserved field (e.g. the 
ip ethernet type is 0x0800, and is a reserved type).  

in the case where the only open channel's consist of raw u-net (not in the 
dag) or raw ethernet channels, the dag is merely a linked-list of eth-
type cells (see the cell specification page).  


figure 4:  raw ethernet in the upf dag



when a raw ethernet packet is received, fields the ethernet source and 
raw ethernet type are compared with 
the corresponding cell values for each element in the linked-list,
until a match is found.  
for the case(s) in which a large number of raw ethernet channels are open, 
performance may be improved by replacing this linked list with a hash table.



tcp/ip (transmission control protocol/internet protocol):  

this is a composite point-to-point protocol.  the outer protocol is ip, and the 
inner is tcp.  i refer to this as a single filter, as only both protocols together 
identify an endpoint.  in reality, they are separate protocols.

the combination of the following fields uniquely identifies a tcp/ip 
endpoint:


 ethernet type	 -- ethernet protocol  
 ip version -- ip protocol
 transmission protocol -- ip protocol (specifies tcp protocol)
 destination port -- tcp protocol
 destination address -- ip protocol
 source address -- ip protocol
 source port -- tcp



figure 5:  tcp/ip composite header



notice that fields from three different protocols uniquely identify a channel.  
this corresponds to a traversal of the packet filter's dag.  upf is designed
to be fast.  this means that in the interests of 
speed, we want to drop a packet from contention as soon as it is realized that 
the packet will not demultiplex to any endpoint.  

of the 7 preceding fields, we know that the packet is not ip if the ethernet 
type field does not match ip (0x0800).  as an optimization, the ip ethernet 
cell is always located at the head of the ethernet-level linked-list.  since ip 
demultiplexing is expensive, this results in just a single ethernet-type check.

at this point, we now know the packet is of type ip.  at the next level in the 
dag, we check the protocol and the ip version number.  if the protocol is un-
defined (i.e. is not tcp or udp, ..., in this case tcp), or if the ip version number 
does not match the filter's ip version number, the packet is dropped.  again, this 
results in traversing a linked-list of protocol cells, or as its referred to in the 
source code, ip_proto cells, until a match is or isn't found.  


figure 6:  at the ip protocol level in the upf dag



if a match is found, then we descend another level into the dag.  at this 
point, we drop the packet if the destination port (tcp protocol), does not 
exist in the filter.  since there can be as many as 2^16 possible ports, we 
perform a lookup into a hash table.  the hash table itself is connected to the 
ip_proto cell corresponding to the tcp protocol.  the hash function is 
defined within the source code by the function hash_func_port().  
since it is possible for multiple channels to exist on the same  
combination, it might be necessary traverse a hash-chain of 
ip_channel_hash cells.  these cells contain the destionation port number, and 
pointer to a channel hash table.


figure 7:  at the tcp/ip channel hash level in the upf dag



the 3 remaining fields, ip source addr, ip destination addr, and tcp source 
port, uniquely identify a tcp channel.  a hash function is then used, defined 
by the function hash_func_chan() in the source code, to hash into a table 
connected to the ip_channel_hash node.  again, there can be more 
than one node connected to a single index in the hash table.  the hash 
function is meant to spread out the different channel combinations, 
so that a chain of  ip_channel nodes will not have to be walked.


figure 8:  at the tcp/ip channel level in the upf dag



if a match is found in the ip_channel linked list, we demultiplex the 
packet to the corresponding endpoint.  

in summary, demultiplexing tcp/ip packets requires traversing the dag 
through 3 protocols.
note that the current implementation does not support ip fragmentation.  
this would be a natural extension to tcp/ip, as well as udp/ip.



udp/ip (user datagram protocol):  

traversal of the dag for udp/ip is nearly identical to that of 
tcp/ip.  the difference between the two protocols is that udp/ip can be 
connection-less, while tcp/ip is always connection-oriented.  this means 
that its possible to establish not only unicast channels, but multicast and 
broadcast channels as well.

traversal of the dag for udp/ip requires the same seven fields that were 
used in tcp/ip.  the difference is that at channel setup time, a unicast, 
multicast, or broadcast channel type can be selected. if the user creates a 
unicast channel, then traversal of the dag occurs exactly as it did for tcp/ip, 
except that the transmission protocol is now udp.  

choosing to open a multicast channel results in creating a new level of the 
dag.  graph traversal proceeds as it did for tcp/ip, all the way to the 
ip_channel node.   in udp, the ip_channel node contains an x_cast 
field, which is set to either unicast, mcast, or bcast.  if the field is 
mcast, then we descend a level to a linked list of ip_mcast cells.


figure 9:  at the udp/ip mulitcast level in the upf dag



each node in this linked list corresponding to an ip_channel with the 
same address information, but with pointers to different channels.  in the 
event that a multicast ip_channel is matched, then we walk the entire 
ip_mcast linked list, and demultiplex at each ip_mcast cell.

if the ip_channel node is of type bcast, then we must demultiplex to 
every active channel on this port (dest_port).  this results in a traversal of 
every hash-chain for every index in the hash table connected to the 
ip_channel_hash node.  the packet is then demultiplexed to every 
unicast and multicast channel open on the port.  if another broadcast channel 
is encountered, it is ignored (since a broadcast is already taking place).

multicast channels result in demultiplexing to many channels.  this involves 
copying the entire packet into multiple regions of user memory, for as many 
multicast channels that are open.  broadcast channels result in even poorer 
performance, since the packet must be demultiplexed to every open channel
on the port. 

in general, multicast and broadcast channels may be useful, but they incur a 
severe performance overhead.





4.3  wild-card channels in ip

both tcp/ip and udp/ip composite protocols support wild-card channels.   
in order to demultiplex to an endpoint, the minimal requirements specify 
that the ip ethernet type, the ip version number, the transport protocol, and a 
destination port must be specified.  the remaining fields, ip destination 
address, ip source address, and the source port can remain un-specified (they 
are declared as a wild during channel creation).  the combination of 3 
wild-card fields results in seven distinct wild card priority levels, which are 
illustrated below.


figure 10:  ip channel hash table priority levels



the combination of only a wild ip source address forms the highest 
priority, while the combination of all wilds creates the lowest priority.  

wildcard channels will only pick up packets if there is no matching channel 
from the next-highest priority level.  this functionality is built into 
hash_func_chan().  each ip_channel hash table is partitioned into 
hash_entries - 7 indexed hash buckets.  during graph traversal on 
packet reception, if a packet cannot be demultiplexed via the indexed hash 
chain, then we traverse each priority level on the corresponding destination 
port.  if a matching wild-card channel is found, upf demultiplexes on that 
channel, and graph traversal ends.  if not, then upf continues searching each 
next lowest priority level until they are all exhausted, at which time the 
packet can be dropped.

note that udp multicast and broadcast channels are implemented as wild-card 
channels.  since the channels are by definition connection-less, the ip source 
address and source port fields are wild.  the down-side of this setup is that 
matching a multicast or broadcast channel requires exactly 3 hash misses (1 
for the missed index, and 2 for the preceding wild-card priority levels).  if a 
u-net parallel program were to rely heavily on ip multicast or broadcast, this 
scheme may require alteration to boost performance.



5.0  using upf with u-net, benchmarks, and demonstration 
programs

you can obtain a copy of the upf u-net source tree, by saving 
this link.  the 
upf code is designed to run on a linux system over fast ethernet.  however, 
it should be extremely portable to any u-net system running over fast 
ethernet.  this version, has been tested and bench-marked on linux 1.3.71 
using the u-net kernel patch (
see the u-net supporting documentation).  

the source tree contains the following items:

the source code for the u-net packet filter extension (./dev-tulip/upf.*)

the modified u-net device driver (./dev-tulip/devtulip.*) for the smc tulip
fast ethernet card.

a user-level interface library to u-net (./libunet/libunet.*) and some upf 
user-level interface routines for creating channels (./libunet/conversion.*)

a program that demonstrates the functionality of upf u-net (./test/
complex.c)

 several bench-marking programs to minimum latency (pingpong_*).  
the completions "*" stand 
for "unet", "eth", and "ip", for raw unet, raw ethernet, and ip (tcp), 
respectively.  these programs can also be found under the ./test directory.

f) the supporting documentation (this document) can found in the 
directory ./docs .




6.0  performance benchmarks
the u-net packet filter was evaluated using a 133mhz pentium and a 90mhz pentium, 
connected to a fast ethernet switch.  the programs pingpong_unet, pingpong_eth, 
and pingpong_ip, were used to test the roundtrip times for sending messages
using raw unet, raw ethernet, and tcp/ip, respectively.  1000 forty-byte packets 
were sent per test.  the following results were taken from several runs.

roundtrip time for raw-unet:  90.55 us/message

roundtrip time for raw-ethernet:  94.30 us/message

roundtrip time for tcp/ip:  109.50 us/message
	


raw-ethernet performed 4% slower than raw-unet.  tcp/ip performed 17% slower than raw-unet,
and 13% slower than raw-ethernet.

raw-ethernet's performance was about as expected.  traversal of the dag is not free,
and requires some cycles. tcp/ip's performance is a little disappointing, especially since
the channel test was connection-oriented, and was the only channel open during testing.  
however, the significant performance drain could be partially attributed to the
hash lookups implemented with the ip filter.  
in order to demultiplex to a tcp/ip channel, a packet must 
traverse through two hash-table lookups.  in its current implementation, both 
hashing functions use a modulo operator.  the modulo of the hash function is taken against
the number of available hash buckets.  the use of the modulo operator incurs a large
expense, and might explain a significant portion of tcp/ip's performance drain.

one way the hash functions can be improved would be to replace the modulo 
operations with an alternative similar operation, 
in order to hash a packet into one of the available hash buckets. 
rather than use modulo, we could logically and the result of the hash 
function with a mask corresponding to the log (base 2) 
of the size of the hash table.  this would perform a function similar to the 
modulo operation while enormously reducing the
computational expense of the operation.

there are undoubtably numerous optimizations one can make to the packet filter
to enhance performance.  this is left as future work.



7.0  how to go about adding a new filter to upf

each filter is some combination of cells and hash tables connected together.  
in meeting the second design goal, the integration of a new filter to upf is 
meant to be modular.  each module requires at least 3 routines.

add_protocol(): a routine to dynamically add a channel of this prototype 
to the dag. if the filter has not been installed for this channel type, then the 
filter is also installed.  if the add_protocol() routine fails, then the channel 
creation up to the point of the error must be un-done.

find_protocol(): this routine should be very fast!  its responsible for 
demultiplexing packets to their endpoints.

deactivate_protocol(): this routine dynamically removes a channel from 
the dag, and de-allocates any memory associated with the channel.  if the 
channel is the last channel of its protocol, then the entire protocol is 
deactivated. this routine is important for long-running processes, where channels 
are created and destroyed based on run-time conditions.  its important that all 
memory be recycled and accounted for.  this routine is not as important for 
short-running programs, such as benchmarks, since the 
upf_shutdown() routine will de-activate the entire dag data-structure. 


the current implementation supports 4 different filters:  raw ethernet, ip, 
tcp, and udp.  for each segmented protocol, there are exactly 3 essential 
routines (see the source code). that is, the aforementioned 3 routines exists for 
every module.  actually, there is only one find_protocol in the upf system 
(upf_findchannel()).  however, this routine is broken up into c case statements, 
essentially breaking down the task of demultiplexing composite 
headers by protocols.  

the designer of a new filter should feel free to define there own cell types, as 
is necessitated by the new filter.  the designer should feel free to modify the 
actual cell structure, if will improve the overall packet filter design, 
and can also define new hash functions as is needed.


8.0  memory management

all memory allocatation in the upf system is chained together off of a 
pointer on the tulip-device structure.  as new cells and hash-tables are allocated, 
a new "wastebucket" structure is added to a garbage collecting list of 
wastebuckets.  each wastebucket points towards the allocated structure.  each 
structure in turn points back to the corresponding waste bucket.  a call to 
upf_shutdown() results in a traversal to each wastebucket.  at each bucket, 
the data structure it points to is de-allocated.  since each structure points to its 
corresponding wastebucket, a call to upf_deactivate() results in proper 
maintenance of the watebucket linked-list.



9.0  other possible extensions to upf

througout this document, some possible extensions to upf have been mentioned.  
in this section, we will discuss a few more.

the current implementation of upf handles multicast and broadcast channels.  
however, in order to properly join a multicast group, a process needs access 
to an ip multicast to ethernet address resolver.  the de facto way of doing 
this now is via igmp.  therefore, the addition of an igmp filter to upf might 
be a good idea.

if a group of u-net processes were to need to dynamically need to create new ip channels,
then they would also require a way to resolve straight ethernet to ip address translations.
the addition of the address resolution protocol (arp) filter to upf 
would also make a logical extension.

in general, as many extensions can be made to upf as is required by the needs
of the u-net user(s) 


10.0  conclusions

the attempt to create a packet filter that can be used
with u-net was successful.  in doing so, i believe that our original design goals were met. 
this is, however, a beginning.  there is still a lot work that must be done in
developing both u-net, and the u-net packet filter.  particulary in 
the case of upf, performance can be improved.  improvements to the current
hashing implementation, and tweaks to the source code in general will 
probably boost overall perforance of the filters.

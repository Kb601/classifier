incrementalization

incrementalization-
a general systematic approach to efficiency improvement

objectives

  we are engaged in an ambitious effort to derive
incremental programs automatically (or semi-automatically) from
non-incremental programs written in standard programming languages.
this approach contrasts with earlier approaches that aimed to
incrementally evaluate non-incremental programs.

  in essence, every program computes by fixed-point iteration,
expressed as recursive functions or loops.  this is why loop
optimizations are so important.  a loop body can be regarded as a
program f parameterized by an induction variable x that
is incremented on each iteration by a change operation +.
efficient iterative computation relies on effective use of state,
i.e., computing the result of each iteration using stored results of
previous iterations.  this is why strength reduction and related
techniques are crucial for performance.  

  given a program f and an input change operation
+, a program f' that computes f(x+y) efficiently
by using the result of the previous computation of f(x) is
called an incremental version of f under +.
sometimes, information other than the result of f(x) needs to
be maintained and used for efficient incremental computation of
f(x+y).  we call a function that computes such information an
extended version of f.  thus, the goal of computing
loops efficiently corresponds to constructing an extended version of a
program f and deriving an incremental version of the extended
version under an input change operation +.  

  in general, incremental computation aims to solve a problem
on a sequence of inputs that differ only slightly from one another,
making use of the previously computed output in computing a new
output, instead of computing the new output from scratch.  incremental
computation is a fundamental issue relevant throughout computer
software, e.g., optimizing compilers, transformational program
development, and interactive systems.  

  

results

   thus far, we have partitioned the problem of deriving
incremental programs into three subproblems:

   p1. exploiting the result of f(x),
i.e., the return value of f(x).

  p2. caching, exploiting, and maintaining
intermediate results of f(x), i.e., values computed in
the middle of computing f(x).

  p3. discovering, computing, exploiting, and
maintaining auxiliary information of f(x), i.e.,
information not computed at all f(x), that can be inexpensively
maintained.  

 we summarize here the essence of our methods: 

  p1. in 
"systematic derivation of incremental programs", we gave a general
systematic transformational approach for deriving an incremental
version f' of a program f under an input change
+.  the basic idea is to identify in the computation of
f(x+y) those subcomputations that are also performed in the
computation of f(x) and whose values can be retrieved from the
cached result r of f(x).  the computation of
f(x+y) is symbolically transformed to avoid re-performing these
subcomputations by replacing them with corresponding retrievals.  this
efficient way of computing f(x+y) is captured in the definition
of f'(x,y,r).

  p2. in  "caching
intermediate results for program improvement", we gave a method,
called cache-and-prune, for statically transforming programs to
cache all intermediate results useful for incremental computation.
the basic idea is to

   i. extend the program f to a program
f-bar that returns all intermediate results,

  ii. incrementalize the program f-bar under
+ to obtain an incremental version f-bar' of
f-bar using our method for p1,

  iii. analyze the dependencies in f-bar', then
prune the extended program f-bar to a program f-hat that
returns only the useful intermediate results, and prune the program
f-bar' to obtain a program f-hat' that incrementally
maintains only the useful intermediate results. 

  p3. in 
"discovering auxiliary information for incremental computation",
we proposed a approach for finding auxiliary information.  auxiliary
information is, by definition, useful information about x that
is not computed by f(x).  where, then, can one find it?
the key insight of this approach is:

   a. consider, as candidate auxiliary information
for f, all intermediate computations of an incremental version
of f that depend only on x; such an incremental version
can be obtained using some techniques we developed for solving p1 and
p2.  (we use techniques developed for solving p1 and p2, instead of
just p1, so that the candidate auxiliary information includes
auxiliary information useful for efficiently maintaining the
intermediate results.) 

 how can one discover which pieces of candidate auxiliary
information are useful and how they can be used?  we proposed:

   b. extend f with all candidate auxiliary
information, then apply some techniques used in our methods for p1 and
p2 to obtain an extended version and an incremental extended version
that together compute, exploit, and maintain only useful intermediate
results and useful auxiliary information. 

  thus, on the one hand, one can regard the method for p2 as an
extension to method for p1; on the other hand, one can regard method
for p1 as aids for solving p2.  similarly, on the one hand, one can
regard the method for p3 as an extension to methods for p1 and p2; on
the other hand, one can regard methods for p1 and p2 as aids for
solving p3.  the modular components complement one another to form a
comprehensive principled approach for incremental computation and
therefore also for efficient iterative computation generally.
although the entire approach seems complex, each module or step is
simple.

  in 
"cachet: an interactive, incremental-attribution-based program
transformation system for deriving incremental programs" we
describe our prototype implementation of these ideas.

 teaching computer graphics and scientific
visualization using the dataflow block diagram language dataexplorer
 


by bruce land, visualization project leader, cornell theory center  

abstract

the scientific visualization language dataexplorer (dx) from ibm has
been found to be useful in undergraduate education as a vehicle for
teaching computer graphics at an introductory level. although it is
designed for scientific data visualization, dx can be used to
construct student lab exercises in computer graphics. dx has been used
for two years as an environment which emphasizes graphics
manipulations (e.g. rotation, perspective) while not requiring the
programming overhead of traditional computer languages.  

introduction

computer graphics is a topic that requires mathematical, programming,
and artistic skills, among others. the content of the computer
graphics fundamentals course at cornell focuses on mathematical skills
but must include programming to illuminate the math. the course covers
the following topics:


   construction of surfaces by explicit polygon lists, by parametric
operations, and by hierarchical grouping of simple objects to form complex
surfaces

 
  modification of objects by 3d geometric transforms in order to position
them in space and animate them

 
  viewing of a group of objects including clipping to a window and
perspective or parallel projection into a 2d screen space

 
  rendering of polygonal and parametric surfaces by hidden surface removal,
shading/lighting, by anti-aliasing, as well as by surface property
modifications such as texture- or bump-mapping 

 
  use of global illumination models to render interactions between
surfaces

   modeling of scientific data for scientific visualization.



the programming aspect of the course attempts to give students practical
experience with many of the techniques taught in lecture. lab exercises
written in dx cover nine computer graphics topics. these exercises include:

 
  construction of polyhedra from vertex and face descriptions;

   construction of parametric surfaces including quadric surfaces (e.g.
ellipsoids), figures of rotation, and tensor-product surfaces (e.g.
bilinear);

   hierarchical modeling and animation of complex objects; 

   writing perspective viewing transforms;

   comparing lighting techniques with wire frame, flat shaded, or gouraud
shaded objects illuminated with ambient and point illumination;

   producing variations on the standard phong lighting model, including
spotlights and bump mapping of surfaces;

   image techniques including production of texture mapped surfaces, image
filtering and anti-aliasing;

   visualization of a 2d scalar field (heights of a landscape) and a 3d
vector field (a flow field); and

   a design project to produce animation based on all the techniques
learned.



all exercises have example programs to introduce the concepts and
descriptions of the manipulations required of the student.  


the first two exercises deal with construction of objects and are an
introduction to dx. in the first exercise, students are introduced to the
notion of polyhedron construction with vertex and face lists. they are
expected to design a couple of polyhedra and perform a simple animation of
one object. they experiment with determining the normals to the surface.
the second exercise introduces parametric surfaces. students design quadric
surfaces, figures of rotation, and bilinear patches. after this lab they
can design quite complex single objects.  


exercise three teaches them how to hierarchically combine objects and how
to concatenate 3d transforms to make complex motion. they design either:

 
  a wagon that rolls forward, stops, then turns its front axle (and
wheels);

   a helicopter with main and tail rotors that starts the rotors, takes off,
and flies away; or

   a prop aircraft that behaves like the helicopter.



when done correctly, the exercise shows them how to design parts of a
complicated object (e.g. props or wheels), move them, and duplicate them
for re-use several times in the final construction.  


in exercise four,  students turn off perspective in dx and write their own pseudo-perspective transform for a simple scene.
this introduces the use of homogeneous coordinates and matrix manipulation
in dx. the calculation is complicated enough to introduce the various
structuring aids of dx which make the code more readable.


exercises five and six explore lighting. students first design a landscape
to be lit by two simulated suns, a white dwarf, and a red giant in two
different orbits. then they turn off the default lighting model in dx
(phong illumination with gouraud shading) and design their own lighting.
they code a lighting model based on light positions, viewer position, and
object normals, and extend the model to produce a spotlight depth cueing
based on intensity.
  

exercise seven introduces image manipulation and filtering. students are
asked to anti-alias a simple scene using postfiltering and to determine a
"best" scheme based on available filters and system resource (i.e. memory,
cpu time). they then edge-enhance an image. finally they texture-map an
image onto a quadric surface by parametrically modifying the image pixel
coordinates. in dx, an image has extent in world space, with each pixel
having a position.
  

exercise eight introduces scientific visualization by having the students
make judgments based on graphical representation of fields. the first part
of this exercise is to identify the geographic location of a landscape
height field, then to enhance the slope and exposure by modifying the
program. the second part is to identify the sources and sinks in a 3d
vector flow field. they are shown how to draw flow lines, vector arrow
icons, and isosurfaces of speed. they then combine these techniques to find
the sources and sinks.
  

the final design project is to produce an animation of hierarchically
modeled objects. typical projects have included:

 
  a robot that stands up out of an ocean, turns, and fires a projectile at
a tower on the far shore; 

   a seagull that flies down and plucks a fish from the water; 

   a castle with waving flags and drawbridge;

   a car driving through a town with rotating signs and street lights;

   a human walking;

   simulation of the deformation of tennis racket strings during a ball
impact; and

   morphing between faculty face images.


the complexity and sophistication of many of the projects can be amazing.  



dx as a programming language

at the introductory level, lack of programming tools often interferes with
learning graphics operations. typically, graphical operations are either
provided as a large library of routines that students must learn, or derive
from relatively simple programming projects that students must code from
scratch. the block diagram interface of dx can be customized to make a
"visual subroutine library" of often-used graphics routines. students can
construct very complex scenes including camera and lighting control in a
short time. they can also "open up" various visual subroutines and modify
or extend them. the graphical nature of the user interface and its easy
extensibility make it possible for students to rapidly prototype a graphics
operation, see the effects and modify the program. the structure of dx that
allows such easy interaction is described next.  


dx is a block diagram, point and click programming language designed for
producing high quality images based on 3d data which may represent objects
(walls, stars) or fields (density, electric field). dx can easily be
extended to construct the objects and perform the operations needed for an
introductory graphics class. the block diagram program is built up of
"modules" and "wires" connecting them. a module is a primitive program
function that appears on the screen as a block with input and output tabs.
wires are dragged with the mouse from outputs to inputs. a group of modules
can be hidden inside of another module to form a user "macro." system
supplied dx modules include vector and scalar field rendering, and
geometric operations (rotate, translate), in addition to x and y plotting.
there is direct programming support for producing custom motif control panels. the theory center has added modules to make parametric surfaces,
texture maps, bumpmaps, spotlights, and a variety of other graphically
oriented functions.  


students are expected to design visual programs to perform some particular
assigned task. they are expected to produce working programs that are
readable and documented. a visual language has a different style of
organization for readability than text-based code, but for programs bigger
than one screen wide, organization is no less important. any module can
have a comment field and the theory center encourages a comment in all but
the most obvious modules. programs tend to build an object of some kind
(e.g. house) by defining its parts, combining them, and then moving them to
some position. such a section of code tends to be small (perhaps 20
modules) but cryptic unless the designer minimally labels the output of the
code block. dx supports labeling of wires to document what is flowing
through them. in many cases a small code block can be made into a macro,
which then appears to be another module with a user-chosen name. at some
point objects have to be combined to make higher order structures. careful
arrangement of the hierarchical structure (which is all visual) helps
during program tracing and debugging. we have found that, as with all
programming, providing a few examples and a programming manual is an
effective way of introducing students to the subject matter.  



conclusions

dx allows students to concentrate on learning the graphics content of the
course rather than investigating the details of a programming environment.
students can generate code to make images in a fraction of the time
required of a c language environment, encouraging experimentation. at the
time of writing, course evaluations are not yet available from students,
but will be when this article appears in forefronts. preliminary student
feedback indicates satisfaction with dx as a vehicle for learning graphics.
the acquired background in computer graphics using dx is already being put
to use in scientific visualization as students incorporate their class
skills into research projects across campus. this year students in the
course were mostly upper division computer science and engineering majors.
it should be possible to construct a freshman-level course using dx which
introduces computer graphics and visualization at an appropriate
mathematical level and whets their appetites for further instruction. 
a downside to dx use in the classroom is that it requires a graphics
workstation such as an iris indigo, sparc station, hp workstation, or risc
system/6000, not a mac or pc, which is the hardware most readily available
to college and university students. hopefully the trend of cheaper
workstations and more powerful personal computers will continue to open new
possibilities. designing complex scenes in dx is easy enough that many
projects put a large demand on the workstations for cpu and memory. during
the final project many of the students ran out of memory while using 32
mbyte machines. in most cases, scaling down the resolution of texture maps
solved the large size, but in a few cases the objects and motions became
too complex.

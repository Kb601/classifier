securing and hardening the horus system




securing and hardening the horus system



a joint project by researchers in the
horus and
nuprl projects at
cornell university
and the
transis project at
hebrew university in jerusalem.





overview


horus
is an adaptable, multi-purpose group communication toolkit for
building secure, fault-tolerant applications.  horus has a modular,
``lego-like'' architecture in which tiny protocol layers are composed at
run-time into protocol stacks with rich sets of properties.  horus
currently includes about forty protocols that can be composed in a large
number of combinations with varying properties and performance
characteristics.

security infrastructure


we are extending horus's flexible communication architecture with
protocols to implement a multi-level security architecture.  in this
architecture, applications will be made secure by inserting standard
protocol layers into their communication stacks.  much of this work
involves incorporating previous security research into the horus
framework, but we are also developing new protocols and techniques
through our collaboration with 
hebrew university of jerusalem





see detailed plans for 
the horus security infrastructure.





validating the horus protocols


an important part of the horus effort is validating the correctness of
both security and fault-tolerance protocols.  our methodology for
validating the horus protocols involves the following steps:

a ``reference implementation'' of our system is built in the ml
programming language.  this implementation compiles into a c
``production implementation.''

the horus protocols are specified in a temporal logic.

the small (around 200 lines) ml protocol layers are imported
directly into the 
nuprl proof development system 
and formally verified.







see detailed plans for 
the validation of horus.




timeline


the schedule for this project runs from september 1995 to september 1998.

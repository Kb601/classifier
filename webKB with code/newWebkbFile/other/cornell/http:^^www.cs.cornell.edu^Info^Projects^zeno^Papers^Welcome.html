compressed domain transcoding of mpeg

    brian c. smith, soam acharya
    abstract
    current compression formats optimize for either compression or editing.
    for example, motion jpeg (mjpeg) provides excellent random and moderate
    overall compression, while mpeg optimizes for compression at the expense
    of random access. converting from one format to another, a
    process called transcoding, is often desirable over the life of a
    video segment. in this paper, we show how to transcode mpeg video to
    motion-jpeg without fully decompressing the mpeg source. our
    compressed domain transcoding technique differs from previous work
    because it uses a new technique that is optimized for software
    implementation and because we compare the performance of a working
    implementation of our compressed domain transcoder, instead of just
    counting the number of multiplies needed to transcode. our
    experiments show that our compressed domain transcoder is 1.5
    to 3 times faster than an optimized spatial domain transcoder,
    and offers another benefit: a single parameter can improve the
    speed of transcoding at the expense of the quality of the
    resulting images. this speed/quality trade-off is important to
    many real-time applications.

cu-seeme vr: immersive desktop teleconferencing
to appear in acm multimedia '96

    jefferson han, brian c. smith
    abstract
    current video-conferencing systems provide a
    video-in-a-window user interface. this paper
    presents a video-conferencing application called cu-seeme vr that
    provides a richer interface.  cu-seeme vr is a distributed
    video-conferencing system that allows users to connect to 3d worlds
    and interact with other using live video and audio embedded in a
    virtual space.  this paper describes a prototype implementation of
    cu-seeme vr, including the user interface, system architecture, and
    a detailed look at the enabling technologies.  future directions
    and metaphors for this space are discussed.

compressed domain processing of jpeg-encoded images
to appear in real-time imaging journal

    brian c. smith, lawrence a. rowe, july, 1996
    abstract
    this paper addresses the problem of processing motion-jpeg video
    data in the compressed domain. the operations covered are those
    where a pixel in the output image is an arbitrary linear
    combination of pixels in the input image, which includes
    convolution, scaling, rotation, translation, morphing,
    de-interlacing, image composition, and transcoding. this paper
    further develops an approximation technique called condensation to
    improve performance and evaluates condensations in terms of
    processing speed and image quality. using condensation, motion-jpeg
    video can be processed at near real-time rates on current
    generation workstations.

a resolution independent video language
presented at acm multimedia 95.

    jonathan swartz, brian c. smith,
    november, 1995
    abstract
    as common as video processing is, programmers still implement video
    programs as manipulations of arrays of pixels. this paper presents a
    language extension called rivl (pronounced "rival") where video is a
    first class data type. programs in rivl use high level operators that
    are independent of video resolution and format, increasing a program's
    portability, simplifying code reuse, and reducing development time.
    this paper also describes a rivl interpreter and the strategies the
    interpreter uses to optimize rivl programs. these optimizations include
    classical programming language optimizations, such as common
    subexpression elimination and out of order execution, image and video
    specific optimizations, such as computing only those images that will
    affect the output, and an optimized memory manager.

query by humming -- musical information retrieval in an audio database
presented at acm multimedia 95.

    asif ghias, jonathan logan, david chamberlin, brian c. smith,
    november, 1995
    abstract
    the emergence of audio and video data types in databases will
    require new information retrieval methods adapted to the specific
    characteristics and needs of these data types. an effective and
    natural way of querying a musical audio database is by humming the
    tune of a song. in this paper, a system for querying an audio
    database by humming is described along with a scheme for
    representing the melodic information in a song as relative pitch
    changes. relevant difficulties involved with tracking pitch are
    enumerated, along with the approach we followed, and the
    performance results of system indicating its effectiveness are
    presented.

tcl-dp name server presented at the

1995 tcl/tk workshop.

    peter t. liu, brian smith, lawrence rowe
    july, 1995
    abstract
    this paper describes a general purpose name server for tcl-dp. this
    name server maintains host addresses and port numbers of services
    running in a distributed en- vironment and allows clients to query
    about them. it starts services on demand so services are guaranteed
    to be available, and it provides a simple authentication protocol
    for better security. the tcl-dp name server is also designed to be
    fault- tolerant. multiple backup servers can be started on
    different hosts, and a failover occurs when the main server goes
    down. in addition, the name server provides mechanisms to interface
    with external modules for extending its functionality.

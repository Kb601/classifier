topics for prelim 2 


topics on prelim 2:

i. object-oriented programming
	+ base classes and derived classes
	+ inheritence
		- functions
		- instance variables
	+ protected keyword
	+ constructors for derived classes
	+ virtual functions
	+ pure virtual functions

ii. program correctness
	+ induction
	+ assertions
	+ truth vs. validity
	+ hoare triples
	+ preconditions and postconditions
	+ the assignment rule
	+ loops
		- loop invariants
		- bound functions
		- 5 steps to proving a loop correct
		- developing a loop using an invariant
			* you need to understand, but not memorize,
			  the lists of step for these last two

iii. gofer
	+ types
		- int, char, bool, float 
		- tuples
		- lists
		- functions
	+ function definitions
		- basic pattern matching (integers)
		- pattern matching with lists and tuples
	+ where clauses
	+ polymorphic types (a, [a], etc.)
		- e.g. what is the type of map?
	+ currying and partial application
	+ the curry-howard isomorphism
		- just kidding!
		- did you know that currying was actually
		  invented by schonfinkel?
		- so it should be called schonfinkelization.
	+ higher-order functions
		- map
		- filter
	+ anonymous functions
	+ lazy evaluation and infinite lists
		- just the basic concept, nothing tricky
	+ efficiency considerations
		- e.g. fib recursively vs. tail recursively

you do *not* need to know about list comprehensions.

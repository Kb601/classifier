prl seminars

here are some of the slides for the talks i have given in the nuprl
seminar.  these slides can be pretty technical, and assume knowledge
of the nuprl system and type theory.  in some cases i
present information at an intuitive level that is technically imprecise.

all slides are in portable document format (pdf).  you can obtain a
pdf reader from adobe for just about any machine you
can imagine using.  i prepared these presentations using adobe
persuasion and adobe illustrator.



modules february, 1996.  this is
my most recent version of formal modules and objects.

modules october, 1995.  this
is an earlier version of formal modules.

horus november, 1995.  we
are performing a verification of the horus group
communication system.  these slides give an outline of the
verification process.

types october, 1994.  these
slides cover some new type additions i was proposing for nuprl.  this
includes very-dependent function types.

square root verification
may, 1994.  this talk is about the verification of a hardware square
root algorithm by program transformation.  the slides don't contain
much explanation.  the paper we wrote
for tpcd 1994
(theorem provers in circuit design) is a better resource.

theories march, 1994.  this
is a very early version of formal theories (modules) in nuprl.

majority vote november,
1993.  this is the first formalization i did in nuprl.  i gives some
idea of the problems i first encountered using nuprl, and it provides
motivation for my current work in nuprl.


some other talks.

horus verification january, 1996.  this
is a very high-level overview of the horus verification effort.

horus verification april, 1996.  here
is a slightly more detailed, but still high-level, version of the horus verification.

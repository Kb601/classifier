this page provides information about using the public software
in /usr/public on the cornell computer science machines.  the
/usr/public directory is the place for files that are useful to the
entire department, but without official support by adm.

current announcements
the public-czar is currently updating these pages and conducting a
periodic cleanup of the /usr/public directory.  if you have somthing
in /usr/public and you haven't used it in a while, please consider
removing it!

synopsis
/usr/public/ is a directory which is mounted on all of the
departmental suns.  it contains all software which is considered
useful to the entire community and is not officially supported by adm.
all software in /usr/public is provided without any guarantees by
other users.  to determine who is responsible for a program, look at
the owner of the executable.

there is also a public-czar that informally manages the directory.
periodically this czar will walk through the directory looking for
space, and if you have installed something, you may receive a message
from the czar asking if the program is still useful.  we are always
short of space, so this may happen fairly often.  the public-czar is
also available to provide assistance if you need help finding or
installing something, or if you feel something needs to be changed.

the public-czar is currently
jason hickey
but mail can be directly sent to the alias "public-czar", which will
always be kept up-to-date.

how to access /usr/public
to access the binaries in /usr/public, include "/usr/local/pub.bin"
into your path (defined in .cshrc).  you should have this at the end
of your path for security reasons.  games are stored in a directory
which may be accessed with "/usr/local/public/games".  many useful
manual entries are also in "/usr/public/man" and may be accessed by
adding to the environment variable manpath.  for example, the
following is a reasonable way to define manpath:

setenv manpath /usr/share/man:/usr/public/man

what is in /usr/public

/usr/public contains user supported software.  here is a list of some
reasonable things to put in /usr/public: compilers for unusual
languages, experimental editors, games, odd utilities, and data files.
sources for executables should be stored in /usr/public/src.  for
security reasons, sources should be available whenever possible.
include manual pages in /usr/public/man.  look in that directory for
some examples.  remember, the manual entry is often the only clue
about what a program does.

there are tips-??? help files in the normal area.  feel free to add
tips files in /usr/public/man/man1.  remember that these files need to
be in troff man format.  look at an existing man page to figure it
out.  if you would like to add www info, contact the public-czar, who
will add it to this file.  there is also an emacs texinfo page, so
documentation can be added that way, too.

all public games are stored in /usr/public/.../games.  these are
managed by the games czar who is ultimately responsible for what stays
and what goes.  sources for most games are in /usr/public/src/games.
please do not make private copies of the games because they waste a
lot of disk space.  in particular, do not copy the ``fortune'' database
file.

what should not be in /usr/public

it is easy to crowd a public disk with useless junk.  core dumps and
object files should be removed as quickly as possible.  executables
should be stripped (see "strip").  large sources for stable programs
should be deleted.  do not throw something onto /usr/public unless
these is good reason to believe that other people might use it.  never
put software into /usr/public which is of questionable origin: viruses
are a daily concern.  if something seems strange, do not hesitate to
bring it up.

/usr/public often fills up.  this leads to lots of finger pointing and
nasty messages so try to be polite.  if you really value something,
but everyone else does not seem to care, move it to your home
directory.

directory organization

/usr/public holds binaries for several architectures.  to make access
somehat machine-independent, architecture-dependent executables are
available in /usr/local/pub.bin, which will always be a link to the
appropriate directory.  architecure-independent files are always kept
in /usr/public/share/...  this includes shell scripts, images,
emacs-info pages, www pages, and other assorted
architecture-independent files.  this is true even though right now we
mostly use sparc/sunos4 throughout the department.  remember, solaris
is on the way, like it or not.  if it makes you feel more comfortable,
add a link from executables you install in /usr/public/share/bin to
corresponding directory entries in /usr/public/{sun4,solaris}/bin.
if you install in the wrong place, the public-czar will always come
around to correct you:-)

here is a summary:

 /usr/public/adm: for the public-czar, look here for stats if you want.
 /usr/public/cdi: various info, this will get incorporated into
     this page.
 /usr/public/hp: hp dependent files.
 /usr/public/include: architecture-independent include files.  this
should be a link to /usr/public/share/include.
 /usr/public/lisp: i don't really know why we have this,
it may go away soon.
 /usr/public/ls: this is just to give you a hard time:-)
 /usr/public/src: source directories
for the installed programs.  any program, whether it is one file or
not, should be installed in a directory here.
 /usr/public/sun4: sun4/sunos4 libraries and
executables.
 /usr/public/sun4/games: games for sun4/sunos4.
 /usr/public/solaris: sun4/sunos5 libraries and
executables.
 /usr/public/share: architecture-independent libraries,
info files, shell-scripts, etc.

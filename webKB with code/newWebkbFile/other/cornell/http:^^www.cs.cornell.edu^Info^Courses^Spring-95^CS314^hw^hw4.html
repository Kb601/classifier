cs 314: homework number 4  




 homework number 4 

date assigned:   february 21, 1995
date due:   february 28, 1995

 to submit your answer 
drop by the consulting office (305 upson) during consulting hours to
get your homework graded and recorded.


in the problems below, you are asked to write several 68000 assembly
language routines. while it is not required, we strongly suggest that
you use basepak to solve this problem set. in grading this problem set,
we will forgive minor syntactic errors, but many occurrences of the
same error will be penalized. all programs should be well commented,
listing any assumptions you made about the problem and how the
registers are used. unless otherwise specified, assume callee-save
conventions are being used. all problems count equally in the final
grade.

 problem 1: bit counting
write a 68000 code fragment that counts the number of bits that
are set (i.e., equal one) in the number stored in register d0. the
result should be placed in register d1. for example, if
 d0 = 1101 0100 1000 0011  on entry to the code fragment,
then d1 should contain 7 on exit. the contents of d1 may be destroyed
by the fragment.

problem 2: machine code 


 give the machine code representation (in hexadecimal) of the
following instructions in 68000 assembler.


  move.l    d0,-(a6)

 what 68000 assembly language instruction is encoded in the
following machine code?

  5c5f



problem 3: control structures
for each of the following pascal control structures, give the 68000
assembler equivalent. assume the variable i is stored in register d0
and x is stored in register d1.


 the for-loop

  for i := 1 to n do begin
    x := x + 1;
  end;


 the while loop

  while (i &lt;&gt; 0) do begin
    i := i-1;
    x := x+1;
  end;


 the repeat-until loop

  repeat
    i := i-1;
  until (i = 0);


 the if-then-else structure

  if (i &lt; 0) then begin
    x := i;
  end else begin
    x := -i;
  end


 the case statement

  case i of
    1:  x := -x;
    2:  x := 0;
    3:  x := x + 1;
  end;

introduction
this project aims to implement a sampling resolution-independent digital
audio engineering tool that can be used to create moderately complex
special effects.  the project should sport an easy-to-use and fairly 
portable interface across various unix/x platforms.  the program should
work reasonably well on all kinds of audio samples, from low-fidelity
voice to cd quality music.  ideally, this program should be able to
utilize commonly-available hardware features such as mono/stereo audio
playback and recording.

general operations
playback

the program should be able to playback the samples being edited for
previewing purposes.  this function does not aim to interface with a
device capable of production-quality audio synthesis.

pause

the program should be able to stop in the middle of a playback.

rewind

the program should be able to return to a certain sample earlier in
time and resume playback from there.

fast forward

the program should be able to skip ahead to a certain sample later in
time and resume playback from there.

seek

the program should be able to start playback at any certain sample in
the entire sound file, indexed by either playing time (seconds) or
sample number.

record (optional)

if hardware support permits, this program should be able to digitize
samples from an external audio source.  in general, however, this
program should assume that samples are digitized by another dedicated
platform because of quality considerations.

volume control

this program should have the ability to adjust the output volume of
the playback function appropriately.  if possible, a decibel notation
should be employed instead of arbitrary volume levels such as 1 to 10.

balance (optional)

this program should be able to adjust the ratio between playback output
of the left and right channels on stereo hardware.

file operations (optional)

currently, the sun audio format (.au) is deemed most appropriate for
reasons of portability and ease of programming.  if time permits, support
should be provided to output resulting samples in the microsoft windows
wave (.wav) format, creative labs voice (.voc) format, and others.


monitors
the following functions do not alter the input samples in any way, but
display them in a manner that might be visually useful (and pretty) to
the audio engineer.

raw waveform

the program should be able to display the pulse-code modulation (pcm)
format digitized samples as a waveform in time domain.  multiple files
can be open at the same time to allow simple edit operations such as
cut, copy, paste, and some others that users
of commercial software would come to expect.

spectrum

the program should display a frequency spectrum synchronized with the
playback to show the distribution of frequencies.  right now, we are
split between the conventional boombox style of discrete frequency
ranges and quantized intensity levels (dancing led bars), or a more
"scientific" high-resolution spectrum display possible only on video
monitors.  suggestions are welcome.

time/frequency/amplitude histogram

the program should display a time domain frequency/amplitude graph such
that time progresses along the x-axis (towards the right side), frequency
ranges are plotted along the z-axis ("in" and "out"), and amplitude
plotted along the y-axis (going up).  this display would be useful in
visualizing amplitude distributions over time.


time domain operations
these functions modify the input waveform in the time domain, and do not
require a fast fourier transform (fft) or its inverse to operate.
all time domain operations can be performed on the entire file or some
selected subset.  these operations should be resolution-independent.

echo

this function digitally simulates an echo.  it will be implemented by mixing
several copies of the sample in decreasing strength with a corresponding
shift in time

fade

these two function incrementally increase or decrease volume over a range
in time.

mix

this function is the digital simulation of mixing two input sources together,
and will be implemented with some form of weighted averaging of the samples.

backmasking

this function reverses the waveform in time, such that the last input will
become the first input, and vice versa.  this function is useful in including
satanic messages into rock songs advocating suicide.

silence

this function creates a range of silence.

amplitude scaling

this function is used to modify the amplitude of a range of samples to
effect an increase or decrease in volume.

resampling

this function allows an input waveform to be upsampled to a higher
sampling frequency or downsampled to a lower.  upsampling is probably
accomplished by interpolation, and downsampling by tossing away samples.


frequency domain operations
the following operations require processing in the frequency domain.

pitch scaling

this function can be used to effect a pitch shifting without affecting
playback speed, useful in making people talk like chipmunks.

graphic equalizer

this function can be used to enhance or inhibit certain frequency ranges,
for example, to reduce noise.  two proposals are being reviewed here, the
first being the traditional boombox graphic equalizer with sliders, or
a free-form tool that will automatically curve-fit certain selected points
and modify the spectrum accordingly.  suggestions welcome.

addition and subtraction

this function allows the addition or subtraction of a spectrum with
another.  this is possibly useful in noise elimination.

morphing

this function can be used to transform one spectrum into another
incrementally over time.

 project description 

kernel endpoint for u-net

one drawback of u-net is that it doesn't
allow existing applications and kernel facilities (e.g. tcp/ip) to easily 
share the underlying network hardware with u-net based user-level 
applications. there are at least two ways that 
this problem can be solved. 

one idea is to implement the required 
services through a library of user level functions that use 
u-net as the transport mechanism. another approach is to actually 
construct an endpoint inside of the kernel, and allow it to access 
the network hardware via the u-net device driver. we decided on the latter 
because in the long run, it should provide more flexibility than the 
library-based implementation. once the kernel endpoint is in
place, any type of 
data can be transmitted across the network, regardless of protocol.
additionally, we may even be able to communicate with non-u-net hosts if we're
careful about using compatible header formats.
our idea is to take advantage of the "virtual network interface" 
provided by the u-net driver and to treat it as a real network card
inside of the kernel.


while any communication using the kernel endpoint will no doubt be
slower than user-level endpoints, the idea is to allow many applications
to multiplex on one kernel endpoint and for existing socket-based apps
to at least run.the idea is not to implement ip or other high-level
protocols; but essentially to replace the low-level kernel functions
for sending data to an atm or ethernet card with routines which read/write
to the kernel endpoint.



 project milestones 

march 28 : project proposal

we have met with matt welsh to get a better idea of what this project will
involve. we believe that the best platform for this project will be on a pc 
running linux, using fast ethernet hardware. ideally, the abstraction 
provided by u-net should allow our code to also work across the atm hardware, 
but whether this proves to be true remains to be seen and is beyond the 
scope of this project. if time permits, this would be a natural extension to 
our work.
it is our understanding that the basic idea of this project is to 
provide the ability for the kernel to 
access the u-net interface via the already written u-net driver. we will 
therefore be writing code to bridge the gap between ip and the u-net 
device driver.
 our understanding through diagrams :
  a look at the network architectures   

april 18 : checkpoint meeting
setup of hardware - two pentium pcs are interconnected through fast ethernet, using a null modem.
setup of software - linux as well as u-net software is loaded on the machines, the kernel code has been compiled.
the u-net pingpong application has been tested to run properly, however, sometimes crc errors are received which are possibly due to absence of fast ethernet hub and also, the expected latency is not obtained.

with this basic setup, we have divided the project into two basic parts, so that each of us can concentrate on one of them,(1) kendpt-lib : a kernel-level implementation of devtulip and libunet.(2) kendpt-dev : a pseudo-ethernet driver that is implemented using kendpt-lib.

 major issues decided to be solved 

issue 1 :  to create a kernel-level endpoint driver that can
accept ip,icmp,etc. datagrams and passes them to the u-net driver which then
handles their transmission and receipt.

issue 2 :  to make one of the u-net endpoints behave as the 'kernel-endpoint', this requires changes to be made in the u-net code to force the 'kernel-endpoint' to the kernel space.this issue requires a thorough understanding of the u-net architecture and driver code.

issue 3 :  to solve the problem of 'when does the kernel-endpoint receive the packets from u-net' and hand it to the ip at the receiving end. the kernel code needs to be scanned to find the right place for this changes. also an efficient method other needs to be implemented.  

issue 4 :  u-net requires that a "channel" be created between two 
communicating hosts before they can exchange data. we need to devise an 
efficient mechanism for activating and deactivating channels as needed. 
additionally, we need to be able to map these channels to their 
corresponding ip addresses. on a large network, we can't maintain a channel
per host, but the overhead of activating a channel is probably too 
substantial for us to activate and deactivate once for every transmitted 
packet.

solutions for the above issues
(april 19- )  getting into the code...wanna-be hackers! here is the kernel code...and the u-net code...go man, hack it! 


 issue 1  the kernel uses a generic "device" structure to represent
all network devices. we can construct a new device struct and trick the kernel
into believing that it's talking to a real network card. we need a large
portion of the functionality provided by libunet, but since we're in the kernel,
we can't use it in its current form. we'll have to rewrite what we need so
that it will work inside of the kernel, and add it to the module. in order
to get at all of the stuff we need tulip_ioctl() and tulip_devs[] will have
to be made global inside the kernel. 


 issue 2(april 22) a process, while in kernel mode, can still 
access user-space memory through macros :get_fs(), memcpy_fromfs(), 
put_fs() and memcpy_tofs().verify_area() is used if write protection is
 allowed in kernel mode, for checking if the area is safe to write. the
 'kernel-endpoint' works only in the kernel space and hence, the above
 functions are not called while creating and deleting endpoints and channels.

 issue 3 (april 23) u-net uses polling at the receiving end. 
from u-net we need to pick up the packets and pass it on to the ip. 
(april 24) we considered polling as 'cpu time wasting' and signals are
 not useful in kernels. the ipc methods are useful only for communication 
between two processes, the problem still remains... (april 25) so, we
 tried implementing wake_up(wait_queue),an upcall function to pass the buffer
  and sleep_on(wait_queue). (april 26) however, it turned out that
 sleep_on-wake_up mechanism is also not required. simply upcall when a
 packet is received... almost no time waste... efficiency increase!!!    
(april 27) but stuck on a problem again... devtulip uses its own device
 structure...oh,have to look through the higher level code...no, we think
 that the layers above ip need not worry about network devices... so no more
 problems! 

(april 28) hey... there can still be further increase in efficiency! can
 we pick up the incoming packets directly from the rx_rings into the ip,
 instead of passing them to the endpoints i.e. bypass the endpoint and
 handover the data directly to the ip???  so we consulted matt welsh (who wishes
 to use our modified code later on for further extensions of u-net) sure, we
 can... but, we need our code to be portable for the atm... plus later on matt
 plans to provide an interface which would let user processes multiplex via
 the kernel endpoint without the ip, so its more flexible if the interface
 looks just like u-net. conclusion : use the endpoint... 
thus, the only extra overhead involved is of copying the buffer once!   

   issue 4
hey, we need to leave something for the next cs516 class to do...  



may 3 : poster presentation

















 project status 
well, the semester is over with, so whether we're done or not, the project is
over with. unfortunately, we ran into too many difficulties, and we never
finished. the majority of the  
code is written, and all of the major issues seem to be resolved.

  expected overhead and future extensions 


thanks a lot ... 
to our instructor, thorsten von eicken for providing us with the 
opportunity (and hardware) to work on this project, and
matt welsh for maintaining his patience while explaining (and re-explaining) 
the u-net driver internals as well as providing us with guidance throughout
this project.

additional thanks go out to alan cox, michael k. johnson, and the 
linux-kernel mailing list for their assistance in solving our linux 
namei() problems.

textbook errors





errata for watt, "3d computer graphics" 
 second edition, addison wesley
 
the bulleted numbers refer to page number.


18 
the first equation on the page has two mistakes. v^2 should read |v|^2.
also vw should read v dot w.

60
the third row, second column entry of t_view should be sin(phi) not sin(theta).

62  the first 4x4 matrix is incorrect. it is not orthonormal 
and thus cannot be the product of two rotations.

72 the second constraint in the middle of the page should read:
"normalizing the range of zs values so that the range of 
d
73 matrix equation (3.1) has an incorrect last column. it should read
[0,0,1,0].

100 h=(l+v)/2 should read h=norm(l+v).

116 equation (4.8) should have a set of brackets so that 
the "1/2" multiplies the entire expression.

117 figure 4.27 is confusing at best. i think that the n vector 
should be h and the r vector should be v.

118 the third equation on the page gives mu as a function of fo. 
the mu should be eta, the index of refraction. the equation is just 
a rearranged version of the one above it.

118 the second numbered bullet should read: "these values of eta ... "

120
  note that in the code the index of refraction is refered to as "mu". 

130
in figure 5.4 the notation "nt dot (p(t)-x)
138 in equation (5.2), the last "y2" in the equation for nb 
should be "ys". the "ns" on the right of the equation for ns should be "na".

187 in figure 6.21 the parametric directions u and v are reversed.

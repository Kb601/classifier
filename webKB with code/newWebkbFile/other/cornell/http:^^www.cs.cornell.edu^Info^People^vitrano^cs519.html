write-up:  1

goal:


the goal of our project is to create a fault tolerant transaction server 
for multiple clients using tcpip as the basis for communication.    



interfaces:


we will be providing service to the ecash application, who will be using our function
stubs, and we will be using the services of stable storage, encryption and possibly 
private email.



schedule:


the schedule with appropriate methods for achieving the desired goals is as follows :







week


goals


methods






1.


single client and single server

fault tolerance.


2 or 3 phase commit.
tcpip with encryption layered on top of it.





2.


multiple client and single server



forking on the server side.





3.


multiple client and multiple server



randomized load balancing on the client's side.
i.e. clients will randomly choose a transaction server.





4.


testing/debugging.  *








5.


preparation for presentation.  *






* if time permits, we may implement a private email communication with
ecash.



design decisions:


communication protocol - tcpip was chosen to be the communication protocol between our
function stubs and transaction servers because ssl is not fully standardized, and may have legal problems
with rsa.  privte email is our secondary choice because of excessive overhead, but may be implemented
later to provide a higher degree of service.

 system requirements 
to use the nuprl/www browser, you should have a world wide web client (html
browser) that can display inlined gif and xbm format images and supports
html fill-out forms.  ncsa mosaic for x-windows is one such client.
most items will still be readable without image and fill-out form support.
one exception: the     nuprl theory/theorem browser
will be will be unreadable without xbm image support.

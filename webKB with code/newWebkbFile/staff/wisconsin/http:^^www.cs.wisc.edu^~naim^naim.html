 bienvenido!

 i'm a new staff member working on the paradyn project. i just finished my
ph.d. at the university of southampton in england and i did my 
undergrad and msc at the universidad simon bolivar (caracas, venezuela).

 i was born in the beautiful city of barquisimeto, venezuela. barquisimeto
is located on the central-western part of venezuela and has a population of
about 1 million people. barquisimeto is also known as the 
musical capital of venezuela. 

 my main research area is performance analysis and visualization of 
parallel programs. however, apart from being a researcher, i like to play
classical guitar. in fact, i studied for a few years with two excellent
maestros: rodrigo riera and antonio lauro.

 i like to spend my time:

 playing guitar 
 reading good books (e.g. sherlock holmes stories) 
 cooking
 watching baseball
 and working too!! :-)

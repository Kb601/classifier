 nikos chrisochoides  
 ph.d.  computer sciences department ,  purdue university , 1992. 





dr. chrisochoides' work has touched many facets of parallel and distributed 
computing. his  work includes (i) research on parallel runtime support and back-end systems for parallel compilers and problem solving environments for 
multicomputers, (ii) parallel algorithms for scheduling, load balancing, 
and data distribution for adaptive computations. he co-designed and 
implemented many key software components of a well-known simulation 
environment,  parallel ellpack .

level undergraduates and above.



 research 

my primary research interests are formal
methods and diagrammatic reasoning.



people commonly use diagrams for problem solving; system design is no
exception.  designers use state machines, circuit diagrams, and timing
diagrams, among others, while designing systems.  formal methods
tools, however, provide little formal support for diagrammatic
representations.  although some tools provide diagrammatic interfaces,
treating diagrams as interfaces to sentential logics overlooks a more
fundamental issue: people reason with diagrams in ways that are not
always captured cleanly - if at all - in sentential representations.



one of my goals is to develop formal methods tools that support
reasoning with both diagrammatic and sentential representations.  as a
starting point, my dissertation
developed a formal logic of diagrammatic representations used in
hardware design and their interactions with some sentential logics
used in existing tools.  at present, i am implementing a verification
tool based upon this logic.

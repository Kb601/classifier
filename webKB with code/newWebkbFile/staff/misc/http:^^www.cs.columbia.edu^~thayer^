  literate programming
  

  the above comes from the folks at 
  info.desy.de
  

  this is a very hopeful group which has been collecting a terrific
  conglomeration of information on literate programming.  this site
  goes well beyond the literate programming originally introduced in
  donald knuth's book of the same name.
  

good stuff for hps
  iworks ftp site with a lot of user-contrib type stuff (iworks ftp)

  this is a terrific collection of pre-configured stuff that goes beyond
  the rudimentary computing environment.  unfortunately the ftpd doesn't
  support enough the unix ls command so you may want to ftp there by hand.

  the hp-pa 1.1 processor, you can get
  hp's manual on-line.
  

precompiled hp binaries

  compiled a lot of good software to get just about anybody up and going
  with all sorts of large public domain systems. (cae ftp hpux9.)

   can be found at the support
   page.

     in raw text format.
    
      
     my netscape hotlist

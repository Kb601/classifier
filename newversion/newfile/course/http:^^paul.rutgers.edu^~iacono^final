 grading 

note: there is no curve. a 59 is an f.


if (final>90)
  grade = a;
else
  if (final>midterm)
    grade = 0.8*final + 0.2*homework;
  else
    grade = 0.4*final + 0.4*midterm + 0.2*homework;


 homework 

homework is due every week at the begining of recitiation. graded homework is given back every week at the end of recitation. to pick up unclaimed homework and midterms please see john iacono during office hours. 

 homework solutions 

note: the following are postscript files. the suggested method of viewing
and printing
these files is to run netscape from a unix based system with ghostscript
installed. for most of you this means running netscape on eden, romulus or
remus while you are on an x-term in a computer lab. you will not be able
to view these files from a pc or via aol. if you need help, please see me
during office hours or after recitation and i can show you in a lab how to 
view these solutions.

to print the solutions, do not use the print command from ghostscript
as it is broken and does not work. 
from netscape, use shift-leftmousebutton to save the homework solution to
a file. then from a prompt run

lpr -pprinter filename


where printer is the printer you wish to print to and filename is the
file you saved the marked pages as. to see a list of valid printer
names type printers.

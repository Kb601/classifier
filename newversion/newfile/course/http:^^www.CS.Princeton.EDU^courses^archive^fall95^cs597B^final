randomized algorithms 
	




randomized algorithms are often faster, simpler,
and easier to analyze than deterministic algorithms.
many recent algorithmic breakthrough --- both in algorithmic
theory and in practical applications --- involve the use of
randomness. for instance, the packet router in the cm-5
is randomized. so are many cryptographic schemes.


the course will introduce students to this exciting
area, while developing all required techniques
from probabilistic analysis. 


 the text will be  randomized algorithms  by r. motwani and p. raghavan, printed by 
cambridge university press. it is a rarity among good textbooks,
in that it is well-written, hard-bound, and costs less than $40.




course prerequisites: mathematical maturity (knowledge of
 probability analysis and
combinatorial enumeration at the level of cos 341) and knowledge
of algorithms at the undergrad level (cos 423).

both grads and undergrads are welcome to take the course.
grading will be based upon assignments, which will be handed out
every two weeks.


 other suggested books 

  the probabilistic method. j. spencer and n. alon. (john wiley.)
  an introduction to probability theory and its applications, 3rd  ed.  w. feller. (john wiley)


 course topics 

 various tools for probabilistic analysis: linearity of expectations,
chebyshev's inequality, chernoff and hoeffding bounds, lovasz local lemma.
applications of these tools to design and analysis of algorithms.
derandomization of algorithms: pairwise independence, use of expanders and
limited independence. markov chains.

 various examples of randomized algorithms will be given throughout
the course, including randomized data structures, game tree search,
routing algorithms, algorithms for  
combinatorial optimization and linear programming, 
number theoretic algorithms, and algorithms for counting and
uniform generation of combinatorial objects (such as matchings).

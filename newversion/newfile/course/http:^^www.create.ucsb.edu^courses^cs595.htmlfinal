seminar--readings in multimedia, digital audio, and computer music
	course number:  cs595j
	time:           thursdays, 5:00 - 6:00 pm

description

multimedia technologies are finding more and more uses in computer
applications and user interfaces. this seminar will survey the technology
of digital audio signal processing (dasp) and computer music, and discuss
several of the important topics in these fields. we will discuss the
technology of digital sound representation, synthesis, processing, and
recording, as well as topics related to virtual reality, multimedia tools,
electronic games, and media data transmission. the readings will be taken
from the leading journals and books in the field, such as "computer music
journal," "acm computing surveys," "ieee computer," and various books and
conference proceedings. participants will also have access to a range of
software tools and www resources for optional on-line experimentation.

the topics will include: 
  -- digital audio signals and their representation;
  -- analysis/synthesis techniques and software sound synthesis;
  -- sound localization and the synthesis of localization cues;
  -- graphical representation of music on computers;
  -- media data storage, transfer formats, and file systems;
  -- the midi protocol and real-time interaction;
  -- music composition using computers;
  -- artificial intelligence, neural nets, genetic algorithms and music;
  -- object-oriented programming and music;
  -- real-time sound distribution on lans and wans; and
  -- unanswered questions and open topics.

a detailed course outline and reading list can be found at the url 
  http://www.create.ucsb.edu/courses/cs595.html.

participants will be assumed to be familiar with some high-level programming
language, software engineering techniques, basic operating systems
principles, and engineering mathematics ("light" calculus and linear algebra).
there is no assumed background in music or audio.

the seminar will be lead by stephen t. pope (stp@create.ucsb.edu), research
director of the ucsb center for research in electronic art technology
(create, http://www.create.ucsb.edu/), editor of "computer music journal"
(cmj, http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/computer-music-journal), and an active
music composer and software developer.

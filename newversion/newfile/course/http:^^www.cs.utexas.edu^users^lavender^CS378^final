description 
this course is intended for students that have already had an
introductory c++ programming course, such as that offered in cs 105 -
introduction to c++.  

the objective of the course is to give the student an opportunity 
to think about solutions to computational problems in an 
 object-oriented  manner, capture  reusable
patterns of design  by constructing  polymorphic type
hierarchies  and write programs proficiently and professionally
using c++. the student will have to opportunity to program solutions 
to challenging problems using c++ and java.

 course texts  
the following texts, available from the ut coop bookstore, are to be used during the course:

cay s. horstmann. mastering object-oriented design in c++, john wiley & sons,1994.
david flanagan. java in a nutshell, o'reilly &amp; associates, 1996.

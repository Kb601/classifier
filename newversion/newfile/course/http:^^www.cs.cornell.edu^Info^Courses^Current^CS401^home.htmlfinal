 converting raw text to postscript
    some people have asked how to convert raw text to postscript.  the
    simple way is to use the unix program enscript.  here are two suggested
    ways of doing this: 
     
    enscript -2r -g -pfile.ps file.txt
    enscript -g -pfile.ps file.txt 
    
    the first prints the files 2-up (good for source code).  the second
    prints them 1-up.  the -g gives a nice header.  this generate a
    postscript file file.ps.  if you leave out the "-pfile.ps", it
    should just send the file to the printer.  
 


more to come!

this course explores the notion of computability restricted to a model of computation with one or more
bounded resources (e.g., time or space). models of computation studied will be chosen from circuits and
various kinds of turing machines: deterministic, nondeterministic, alternating, and probabilistic. emphasis
will be on the mathematical structure of classes of problems rather than on individual problems.

rules

homework

grading.  the whole semester of homework will contribute 50% to the final grade.
(the other 50% will be contributed by the two exams; see below.)  there may be
more homework assignments than we are able to grade; also only a part of an
assigment may be graded.  however, you will get solutions for all homework
exercises.
 
timing. each homework assignment is due on friday of the next week (next to
the week the assignment had been given). we will try to grade the gradable part
within a week.

groups.  you are encouraged to form groups to work on the homework
problems.  the process of group interactions should help you to
understand the material better and especially to master proofs; try to
convince your colleagues in the validity of your proofs, and be
critical about their explanations.  only one copy of the completed
homework assignment need be submitted for each group.  make sure all
group members names are listed on submitted assignments!  all members
of the group will receive the same score.

exams

there will a final exam (30% of the final grade) and one intermediate
exam (20% of the final grade) on nov 8.  both exams will be closed
book, closed notes.

the honor code

the system is built on trust.  see the um policy on the subject.

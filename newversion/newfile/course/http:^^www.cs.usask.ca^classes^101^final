assignment #4 is available for everybody to get started on.  there
are a few details and corrections which are still being worked out.  i
will be available in the alibaba lab on friday, march 29th from 12:00
until 1:00 for any 101 students who require assistance.  this
assignment is much more demanding than the exercises and assignments
in the past, so don't leave it until the last night.

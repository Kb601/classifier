 research: 
my main interests are in distributed systems, object-oriented languages and software engineering.

currently, i am working on global memoy management in a workstation cluster with

new high-speed networks greatly encourage the use of network memory as a cache for virtual memory and file pages, thereby reducing the need for disk access. network nodes with memory-intensive applications can use the primary memory of lightly-loaded nodes as temporary backing store. this introduce a new level of the memory hierarchy: namely, a global memory cache that lies (logically) between local memory and disk.
because pages are the fundamental transfer and access units in remote memory systems, page size is a key performance factor. recently, page sizes of modern processors have been increasing in order to provide more tlb coverage and amortize disk access costs. unfortunately, for high-speed networks, small transfers are needed to provide low latency. this trend in page size is thus at odds with the use of network memory on high-speed networks. we studied the use of subpages as a means of reducing transfer size and latency in a remote-memory environment.

i did my thesis research on debugging in an distributed object-oriented system in 1993 at the

universite joseph fourier,
 grenoble .
i was involved in the 

guide
project at the 

laboratoire bull-imag
, part of the 

imag
institut.



fun: 


there is a way to go to the extreme people &reg area. it's

not here.
 

visit the louvre gallery 

 


look at the maps of
 france , 
 europe  
and 
 world  .


some

family pictures.
 

some

friends pictures.

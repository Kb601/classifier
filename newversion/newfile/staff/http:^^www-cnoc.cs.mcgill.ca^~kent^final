gated, produced by the cornell gatedaemon project, is a modular software
program which supports multiple routing protocols and protocol families.  
follow the link at the end of this page for more information about gated and
the gated consortium.
my reponsibility is to continually maintain and implement new gateways as the 
need arises.  a network restructuring plan has been made for the computer 
science network.  here are sketches of the before and after.


 genesis project
the genesis project is a code name for the installation and maintenance of
computer operating system.  the goal of this project is to provide a quick 
and easy service to updating operating system programs and files, 
applying patches, installation of a newly arrived computer on the destination
desk within 30 minutes of receipt of the computer.


 mbone
the mbone stands for the virtual internet backbone for mulicast ip.  the 
school of computer science joined the mbone in the summer of 1994 and 
acted as the mbone provider for mcgill university until january 1995 when
the responsibility was given to the computing centre (we are still acting
as a backup source).


 netrek server god
a vanilla server is running on netrek.cs.mcgill.ca on port

academic interests

my interests are related to presenting information to the user.
i am particularly interested in presenting both detail and context in a
single, integrated image using non-linear transformations.
i have focused my efforts on presenting images of graphs - there are a
couple of tech reports and a paper in my publications
directory detailing this work.

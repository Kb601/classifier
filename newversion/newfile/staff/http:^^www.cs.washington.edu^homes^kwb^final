    the juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for
   a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its
   home for life.  for this task it has a rudimentary nervous system.
   when it finds its spot and takes root, it doesn't need its brain any 
   more so it eats it.  it's rather like getting tenure.

 research 

i'm currently working on building a high-speed, low-latency
lan from chaotic routers (see below).  my previous research
has been on chaotic
routing, which is a form of non-minimal adaptive routing for
massively parallel multicomputers.  



 about me 

 professional  

i am an assistant professor of electrical engineering at 
seattle pacific university.  i'm also working part time as a research
associate at the university of
washington.  all significant papers i've written are in the  archives  of
the chaotic routing group.

i spend most of my time 
teaching electrical and computer engineering
at seattle pacific university.

lorie liebrock's research interests are in using problem topology during
compilation. in particular, the use of topology to automate data distribution 
and to allow application of regular application optimizations to partially 
regular problems.

she has developed algorithms for automatic distribution of irregularly coupled 
regular mesh (a.k.a. composite grid or multiblock) problems, e.g., aircraft 
aerodynamics and water-cooled nuclear reactor simulations, via the use of 
problem topology. 
for use with these automatic distribution algorithms, she has developed 
a program template and a set of style guidelines for
these applications that allow automatic transformation of an application
code with no notion of data distribution into a standard high performance 
fortran program with complete distribution specification.

dr. liebrock is a member of acm, ieee, and ieee computer.

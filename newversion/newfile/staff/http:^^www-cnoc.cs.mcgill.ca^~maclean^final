in an effort to keep this really simple and to save a bit of
bandwidth i've cut my home page down to the bare minimum of
informational content.

quite simply i have been working for the school of computer science
as a systems administrator for five years. my specialties
are sun workstations and servers running sunos and solaris. although
i have been known to look at other vendors machines.

i've included a couple of links to sites i think are important.


usenix flunky
member of the system adminstrators guild (sage)
sun managers archive
system administrators job descriptions
unix guru universe

as an added bonus (please no snickering from the peanut gallery) i've
included a link to a tutorial i wrote on programming in c on unix. my
only disclaimer might be that if you write code for critical systems,
don't read this tutorial. some might even say "don't program in c".

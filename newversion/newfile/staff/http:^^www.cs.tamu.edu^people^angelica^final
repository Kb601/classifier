just a few things i find absolutely amusing

the totally hip calvin and hobbes  home page 
 fox trot  is another one of my favorite comic strips.
frank lloyd wright , need i say more.  after viewing a few of his home pages; i have come to the conclusion that this is the best one.  if for some unforsaken reason, you do not know who frank lloyd wright is. please check out this home page. 
my tribute to soccer .  i hope that i do not disappoint anyone with my heroic attempts to do this great sport justice.

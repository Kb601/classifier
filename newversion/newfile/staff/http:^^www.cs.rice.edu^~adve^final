vikram adve



vikram adve is a research scientist in the computer science department
at rice university.  his research interests broadly lie in the design
and performance evaluation of parallel computing systems, spanning
performance modeling, parallelizing compilers, and parallel computer
architecture.  his current work primarily focuses on optimizing
compilers and programming environments to support machine-independent,
data-parallel programming.

research


advanced compilation techniques for data-parallel languages
we are developing a second-generation

high performance fortran (hpf)
compiler to serve as a platform for experimental research on:

 compilation techniques for regular and irregular
     data-parallel applications,
 optimization for message-passing, shared-memory, and hybrid
     architectures,
 first-class compiler support for programming tools
     for performance analysis and data layout selection.



programming tools for data-parallel languages
we are developing techniques and tools that enable programers to
understand and tune the performance of data-parallel applications without
having to understand the extensive, machine-dependent transformations
performed by a sophisticated, parallelizing compiler.  
extensive cooperation between the compiler and performance tools is key to
providing the detailed, source-level performance feedback required 
in order to fulfill this goal.

andrew m. boardman

perhaps, as per local custom, i'll have a picture here eventually; i'd
actually be fairly suprised if there was anyone reading this who
didn't already know what i look like, though.  all the usual inane
pointers and silly quotes and random cruft can wait until i have some
spare time.  1996, maybe.

mail to amb@cs.columbia.edu.  i'm often found wandering around, or try
upstairs.


things available here, perhaps of possible interest or utility...

 pgp key block
 various aviation stuff (fplan is here)
 current norad satellite elements
 the british cycle supply catalog
 best keyway cross-sections
 some stereoscopic good advice
 do  not  press this button
 stuff i keep track of (random pointers)

pascale fung 
phd candidate



i am currently a phd candidate in  computer science at  columbia
university. i received my msc in computer science from columbia in 1993
and my bs in electrical engineering from  worcester
polytechnic institute in massachusetts in 1988. 

i have been a research
affiliate with  at&t bell laboratories (murray hill, new jersey) since 1993. i was a teaching faculty at the department of electrical and electronic engineering of the hong kong
university of science and technology.
during 1991-1992, i was associate scientist at  bbn systems & technologies (cambridge, mass.), participating
in the design and implementation of the byblos speech recognition system. 
i was a visiting researcher at  limsi, centre national de la recherche scientifique (france) in
1991. from 1989-1991, i was a research student in the  department of information science, kyoto university (japan).
prior to that, i was a visiting researcher at  ecole centrale paris (france).

research interests:
statistical machine translation and natural language processing; speech
processing; speech recognition; speaker adaptation; pattern recognition;

andy's home page 
 welcome to my home page!

thank you for stopping by in your cruise of the ever-slowing "information superhighway".



as you can probably tell, this is just the first pass in my attempts to build
a homepage worthy of your time. i know i'm not there yet, but, as free time
permits , i'll be exploring the intricacies of html.



 so, who am i? 

well, i just started my second year as a ph.d. student in the  
computer science department at 
the johns hopkins university.  i'm working
under dr. russel taylor, in 
medical robotics and computer assisted surgery.

this summer, i co-taught a data-structures with my roommate 
scott weiss and
some other random guy, 
stephen kobourov. 



i graduated from rice university in 1995,
with a degree in
 computer science and
 cognitive sciences.


during my stay at rice, i was a proud member of 
jones college 
and a two time inhabitant of 
third south.
i also played in the mob.

i grew up in fort worth,
texas, where i graduated from hsep (which
now has an entry

on alumni.net).

there's not much else to say, so thanks for stopping by, and good surfing!

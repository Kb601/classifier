my advisor is professor

 projects & interests
 my current interests are in parallel algorithms and programming, 
theory of computation, and graphics and visualization.  these are some
projects i've worked on recently:


    

  this picture (from a ct scan of a lobster) was rendered using 8 sun
workstations, a modified version of phil lacroute's volpack software, and the oxford bsp library (thanks to 
john danskin  for the data.)

  
  recently, i worked on a
project with rocco servedio involving human correlation-detection
ability.  we have a  paper describing
the results of our experiment.  try our experiment over the web! start
by clicking on the frog at left.  (the first page may take a while to
load.)

    
 this is
an image made up of 80 mr scans of a human brain.  i took the
data from the  whole
brain atlas.

 the colors show a labelling of the brain into four possible
materials (unknown voxels are transparent).  the algorithm involved
stochastically optimizing this classification using the swendsen-wang
algorithm (originally developed for simulations in statistical
mechanics.)  it took a long time. this was part of a final project for

computer vision.   this  is a paper
describing my project.  

 
  
 

 another project involving volume rendering: i wrote a simple
volume renderer as a  computer
graphics  final project.  these two images are frames from short
video sequences.  click on them for the animations.  (thanks to
professor  david dobkin
for letting me use princeton's realityengine to make these.)  the ct
data are classified into three materials: bone (white), fat (greenish),
and soft tissue (orange).  the first animation shows bone rendered 70%
opaque, fat 50% opaque, and soft tissue 40% opaque.  in the second,
first soft tissue, and then fat are rendered gradually more
transparent, leaving only bone.  see ``volume rendering'', by drebin,
et al in siggraph '88 for more details of the rendering
algorithm. 

 

   

 i wrote a program called lafite
for exploring the symmetries of 2-dimensional hyperbolic isometry
groups.  it has a limited interactive www front-end which you can try
by clicking on the picture at left.  this 
paper (500k, compressed ps) contains some background about lafite
and the mathematics behind it.  the full version of lafite runs only
on sgi's, the source is available here.
(apologies for the out-of-date documentation.) 

   
 i also wrote some code for the environmental artist agnes denes.
her current project ``tree
mountain'' involves planting 10,000 trees on a sculpted man-made
mountain in the pinsio gravel pits, ylojarvi, finland.  this picture
shows a version of the pattern with only about 1,700 trees.  this
project was work with professor john conway and tim hsu at the
princeton  mathematics
department.

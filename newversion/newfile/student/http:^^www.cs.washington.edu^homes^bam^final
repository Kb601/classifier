 i'm a second-year cs grad
student at uw who's actually a liberal artist interested in
linguistics.  confused?  good. you're getting to know me already.  

my ultrahotlist - my favorite few web sites of
all time.

 search the web or look up some online references if you're looking for
something my glorified hotlist doesn't
have. or use uroulette
to go to a random url in the web.


find out about me - past institutions (few of
which were mental), résumé, personal info, quote file, favorite songs
and poems, fictitious thrash band, purity test, and original works.

 how to
keep in touch - finger info, mail info,
guestbook, and pgp info 

pages
from a few friends

 the idea for including asl
fingerspelling snapshots was blatantly stolen from brad chamberlain.

i'm currently a graduate student at univ. of washington, in
the department of computer science (officially cse).  my
office is 431 sieg.  i'm working with the rapid project.
i used to say that i was a first-year student, but during the
summer after my second year, someone expressed concern about
this characterization.
where am i?  i'm usually somewhere in north seattle, where i
live and go to school.
yet another picture and one more (the best of the lot).  one
of these days, i'll get around to scanning in some better ones.
a norwegian poem i like
a collection of fortunes received by me &amp; friends at local
chinese restaurants.

mundane stuff
i hope some folks might find this stuff useful.
my hotlinks pages
stuff i maintain
my schedule (if i've remembered to update it)
contacting me
i love to travel (but i don't necessarily tell everyone when i
do)
hiring me
where did i come from?
i got my high-school diploma from live oak high school in
morgan hill, ca, where i was taught prolog for the first time.
i graduated in computer science and engineering from
uc davis, where i was taught prolog for the second time.  (and
yes, i was taught prolog once more at uw.  i'm just glad i
didn't use it during my year at the university of bergen.)  i
also did research for a professor in the electrical and
computer engineering department.
fun stuff

while i was at uc davis, my partners in various cs-related
activities tended to be matt, chris, and james.  (we even
got together recently, using chris's marriage to joanne as an
excuse; chris's brother also made it
in the photo.)


throughout my undergraduate years, i kept biking more and more,
but never very far (davis isn't that big, and it's flat).
during my year as an exchange student to the university of
bergen, i biked hillier and longer routes, so when i returned
to davis, i took up rollerblading, since biking around town was
now too easy.
my biking dropped off during the year i worked at hewlett
packard, but it returned with a vengeance when i moved to
seattle.  i've done the annual seattle-to-portland bike ride in
two days; i may do it in one some year.  but that's only in
season (march/april-june).  the rest of the year, i just
commute by bike and do lots of dancing, particularly lindy
hop.




did you know that every html document should have a header line
that looks something like this:
	&lt;!doctype html public "-//ietf//dtd html//en//2.0"&gt;

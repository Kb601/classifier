(i like mathematica)


welcome! i am a graduate student in both the 
mathematics and 
computer science 
departments at wesleyan university.  
my research interests include category theory in computer science, 
in particular the categorical semantics of logic programming, 
as well as the design of logic programming languages.

i am currently teaching 
calculus at 
wes and statistics at middlesex
community college.



computer related hobbies
in my spare time i like to escape the declarative paradigm and hack away.
i love quintus prolog but sometimes i like to get my proverbial hands
dirty elsewhere.  here are some other environments i use.

 
delphi 
  visual basic 
  java

i am working with professor j.c. browne on the design and
implementation of device control software (a.k.a. device drivers).  
we are investigating the creation of a domain-specific 
programming environment for constructing this class of 
software.


the focus of our work thus far has been on language and compiler 
technologies.  we have devised a prototype domain-specific language for 
specifying device control softare called vdl (virtual device language).  
this language contains various features for reducing the effort 
required to construct this class of software.  a reference manual
for vdl is currently being constructed.  a  
postscript draft  of the manual is available for viewing.  
example vdl specifications are also available for viewing.


vdl specifications for the 8253 counter component are available in 
the following files:

  c8253.pcn  (physical component interface file) 
  c8253.vcm  (virtual component implementation file) 
  c8253.vcx  (virtual component export file) 
  c8253.vcn  (virtual component interface file) 


vdl specifications for the pc-lpm-16 multifunction i/o device are 
available in the following files:

  lpm.pdn  (physical device interface file) 
  lpm.vdm  (virtual device implementation file) 
  lpm.vdx  (virtual device export file) 
  lpm.vdn  (virtual device interface file) 


 transparencies  used in a recent presentation 
are also available for viewing.  they were created using microsoft powerpoint
version 7.0b for windows 95.

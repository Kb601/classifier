since august 91 i'm on leave of absence from the computer science department
of the university
of sao paulo (brazil), pursuing a phd degree at unm.

my current reseach interests are distributed object 
computing (corba),
object databases,
and orb/odbms
integration. 

now a terminal ("all but dissertation") phd student, i'm doing my resarch work
at the advanced computing lab of the
los alamos national laboratory, in the
sunrise/telemed
project. my phd dissertation will be entitled persistence in
distributed object systems: orb/odbms integration.

before joining sunrise/telemed, i did systems software for massively
parallel machines, as a member of the sunmos/puma group.





    not an abd anymore, it is all over now!
    
    information on my phd work is available here.

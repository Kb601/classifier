  let us not wallow in the valley of despair. i say to you, my
  friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow. 

  i still have a dream. it is a dream deeply rooted in the
  american dream. 

  i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and
  live out the true meaning of its creed. we hold these truths
  to be self-evident that all men are created equal.

here is the bomb home page, from ksg himself.  it's hard to
believe this mundane homepage has taken so long to put together, and
still not a single picture! 

well i am a third year phd student here in ucsd's cse dept  
.  i am currently doing research with larry carter
 in performance programming.  we are part of the 
high performance computing lab. 


here are my papers.  well just one paper right now, but soon... 

alpern, b., l. carter, and kang su gatlin 
microparallelism and high-performance protein matching  
supercomputing '95



slightly more recreational stuff

what i have here now are the cds  in my changer and three cds i am going to rotate
in.   this will tell you a little somethin' about my musical taste.

here is a workout routine that i have tried.  it's tough, but it
probably works if you follow through with it.  it is berriman's workout regiman
based on periodization.  if you want to try something, try this! 
.

and here are a couple of friends on the web:
ct aka e
ted carson

adam taylor

adam edlavitch

edray

if your a friend of mine and i don't have your homepage listed, let me
know!

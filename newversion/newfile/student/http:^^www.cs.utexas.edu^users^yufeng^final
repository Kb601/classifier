  about me...
    
	i'm a graduate student in  
	department of computer science  at
        
        the university of texas at
        austin.
          i got my b.s degree in 
        physics from  
        peking university in 
         china . 
	peking university is the 
   	top one university in china, and has the most 
	 
	beautiful campus.
         before i came to austin,
        i stayed in  miami 
        for almost three years doing research on 
	 marine physics at
	 university of miami. 
	i had so much fun there.
	 here come my wonderful wife 
	and my cool mustang.

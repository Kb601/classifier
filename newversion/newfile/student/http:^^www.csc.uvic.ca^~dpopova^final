research topic
building a translator from csp language to c++.



description of research
one of the useful formalisms for designing concurrent real-time systems is the process algebra called csp, or communicating sequential processes.  csp statements can be used to model a system's control and data flow in an intuitive  way.  these statements can be executed and debugged until it is clear that the desired behaviour has been accurately captured.  moreover, csp is an algebra with precise rules, so it is possible to prove certain properties (such as the absense of deadlocks) of the design.  the task of the translator is to automatically produce compilable code from csp statements.  if the csp statements have been properly verified, then such code can have the advantage of being  "correct by construction".  this goal can be accomplished by devising a technique for translating from csp to c++. more details can be seen in the thesis outline page.

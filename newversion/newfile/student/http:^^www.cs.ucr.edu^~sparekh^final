 rsc - the world's biggest waste of time
what, you may well ask, is rsc?  rsc is none other than the world famous,
incomparable rec.sport.cricket,
a forum for the most in-depth and enlightening discussion on the ins and outs
of cricket.  in other words, if you want to observe a bunch of indians,
pakistanis and sri lankans, a sprinkling of people from down under, an 
odd englishman
or two, a lonely west indian and the random south african argue passionately
about  whether it is being pedantic to require a team to show up for
a match when they know their opponents are not going to show up  and
other such earth shatterring issues, then
indeed this is the very place to be.
 
crossaccess corporation : the place where i have worked two summers
since i have had a good time working for crossaccess especially this summer
i am going to put in a gratituous plug for them.  check out their web
page at www.crossaccess.com to 
see what they are all about.

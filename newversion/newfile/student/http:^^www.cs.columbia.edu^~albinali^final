sabah's home page

welcome to
sabah's
fledgling home page. its construction has been abandoned for the 
time being. yes, yes, i know that it's pathetic, but that's life. 



i am a fourth year phd candidate in the 
computer science department
at
columbia university.



if you're a ti member, check out my 

tiger inn home page.






here are my current bookmarks

you may find my

bookmarks interesting (then again, you may not).

working for you...



i was born on october 11, 1967, in athens, greece. 
in 1990, i graduated from the department of computer science 
and engineering of the university of patras, greece.
in 1991, i joined the ph.d. program of ucsd receiving my ms 
one year later. my area of interest is theoretical computer 
science and my ph.d advisor is 
 russell
impagliazzo.

i believe in those who study their science because of love for
her, against the usual

 - pressures for hasty results
 - vain antagonisms for convenient recognition
 - unethical concessions for carreer improvement
and insist on
 - respecting the scientific research
 - trying to unserstand clearly even what is already known
 - striving for learning
 - being free.

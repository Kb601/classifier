welcome to giuseppe sena's (tony) web page
 



the first thing you need to know about me is that everybody calls me 
   tony. i am a ph.d. student in the 
   college of computer science at 
   northeastern university. as a good
   italian i love futbol (or what americans call soccer),
   and if you love futbol as i do you'll find 
   these links pretty cool. of course, if you ask me i would say
   that the best futbol player in the world is 
   roberto baggio.
   if you want, you can get more 
   information about me or you can see some 
   family pictures

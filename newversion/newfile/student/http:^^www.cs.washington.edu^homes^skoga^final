 hi there! my name is shuichi koga (if you haven't noticed by
now). i've just started up graduate studies here at the university of
washington. i haven't quite figured out what i'll be doing yet for my
quals (much less my dissertation!).

 i graduated from the university
of virginia in may 1995 with a degree in mathematics. i was also
heavily involved with the asian studies, foreign relations, and
government departments (i was originally slated to also get a degree
in asian studies). i also was heavily involved with the user interface group
and the computer science
department working on a project called alice.

since you're here anyways, why don't you take a look at...

       smaller one (18k).

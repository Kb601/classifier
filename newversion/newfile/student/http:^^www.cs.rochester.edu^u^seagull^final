amon seagull's urcs home page 



i've always thought these bios are lame, but then i realized: what else goes on a 
home page about me?

i got a degree in math and cs from u.penn  in 1995, 
then came here that fall.  i'm 
interested in natural language and knowledge representation, and i anticipate 
working on the trains project  over the next few years.

ok.  that's the briefest of the brief.  here are some  links  i've found interesting/useful.


 csc108 
i'm also ta'ing csc108  this term.
for some helpful info and pointers (but beware of policies that are
specific to his lab), check out amit singhal's 108 web page .  also
on line are  grades for my cooperative
learning section  of 108, organized by the last 4 digits of your
student id number.  note that you should refer to the 
grading policy  for the course first if you have any questions.

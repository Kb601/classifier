dave bullas's home page
welcome. this page is, well, mostly destroyed. gone. so-long, good-bye. toasty. next time, i'll *remember* to change directories before i ftp stuff into my web_docs directory.

oh well, enough complaining. this page is now officially under construction. use at your own risk.

this is a picture of dave:


pretty lousy, eh? well, the guy sort-of pictured here is called dave
bullas. a somewhat unassuming sort of fellow who used to be known in
other circles as warlord or windraven. dave has recently started a
masters degree here at the university of alberta. so far, so good. he
hasn't died yet anyways. he is also taing computing 601, which is a
grad course designed to integrate new tas into the u of a comp sci
experience and prepare them for their taing duties. along with this
job comes dave's new official title: ta training co-ordinator, which
is really just a fancier way of saying the same thing: grunt.

dave is still married to the most incredible woman in the known
universe, michelle. michelle is right now working full time with an
eye to putting money away for a trip to europe (for both of us, thank
goodness) and law school (for her, also thank goodness).

that's probably more about dave than you wanted to know, but i thought i'd leave off with methods of getting hold of dave (tm):

office: cab 489
office phone number: 492-5869
home phone number: 988-8669
e-mail address: bullas@cs.ualberta.ca
telepathic identity: n/a. if this is your desired method of contact, check for me at the limiting interchange near algor iv.
irc: hah! not likely.
if you are really bored, check for me at fics, the free internet chess server (164.58.253.10 or dns.onenet.net). play some chess. my handle there is windraven.
if all else fails, check the uacs office (gsb 275). if its between noon and 1:00pm during the week, i'm likely in bob beck's office with the nhl. gsb 207 - check for me there. and, occasionally, you'll find me in the basement of sub near the uapgc or uacc offices.


recently certain people have told me to make my .plan smaller. well, i compromised and moved it here.

a certain substance

this page and the ones it points to are basically just a fancy version
of my hotlist--stuff i think is interesting that's out on the web.
eventually i may add personal details, like fascinating facts and
spicy gossip about my life.  it'll be just like tiger
beat.


 muds
 oops, i mean "text-based virtual realities".

 www
 this is where you came in.

 some colleges in boston
 just what it sounds like.

 papers
 some papers i like.

 electronic texts
 i'm not sure how this is different from "papers", but it is.

 information sources
 places to go searching for stuff.

 sites
 servers that are interesting for themselves, not just for what
they contain.

 hypertext
 maybe it should cut down on the caffeine.  maybe i should.

 computing and the humanities

 personal info

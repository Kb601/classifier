note: if you show a blue ribbon
,
such as
&lt;img
src="http://www.eff.org/pub/graphics/icons/blueribbon/rib_trn_plain_sm.gif" alt=""&gt;,

prohibition in the u.s. national telecommunications bill.
(likewise, white letters on a black background.)

beth: ``everybody needs a pardo around sometimes.''

pardo: ``sometimes?''

beth: ``there's only one, so we have to share him.''

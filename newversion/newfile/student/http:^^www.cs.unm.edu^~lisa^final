graduate student: lisa maynes desjarlais 


i obtained a b.a. in physics from 
 cornell university
in 1981, and an m.s. in computer graphics from 
 cornell university's program of
computer graphics in 1986.
i am currently working on a ph.d. in computer science at the
  university of new mexico 
in the area of genetic algorithm-based machine learning.
my advisor is

stephanie forrest.




 

recent research projects


i am looking at ways to combine two forms of genetic algorithm-based 
machine learning--learning classifier systems (lcss) and 

 genetic programming 
(gp)--in hope of remediating the limitations of one 
approach with the abilities of the other.

i conduct my research at the 
 
 intelligent systems and robotics center
at  
 sandia national laboratories.
for them, i am also developing a simulator for large numbers of 
autonomous agents moving within and interacting with a physical environment. 
the agents are tiny robots, or "robugs", which we will eventually really 
build. 
in the current version of the simulator, geometric and physical aspects of 
the simulation, such as visualization and sensor simulation, are implemented 
using sgi's performer package. i am currently trying to implement my first
sensor, a whisker, using performer's line segment intersection capability.
when we've got the basic physical simulation going, our emphasis will
shift to effecting, testing, and automatically generating robug behavior,
first of individual bugs and eventually the collective behavior of
swarms of many bugs. the robug simulator will become the
testbed for the learning algorithms i'm developing for my thesis.

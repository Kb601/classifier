welcome to this newly constructed homepage!  random inspiration struck me to
get my act together and actually put a homepage up.  it's not much, but it 
takes up disk space, which is at least one of the purposes of a home page.
consider this page to be under heavily abandoned construction.




and now... the links!


who is this charles cruden guy anyway?

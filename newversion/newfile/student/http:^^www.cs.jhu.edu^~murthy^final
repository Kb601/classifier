i moved from johns hopkins university to the imaging & visualization 
department at  siemens  corporate research, princeton,
new jersey in november 95. contact information. 
 
a postscript version of my (outdated) resume is here.

 

 research 
i am interested in solving real-world 
classification  and  prediction  problems
using  machine learning  and other data analysis 
techniques. my current domain of interest is 
medical image analysis . i am very interested in  knowledge
discovery  from data repositories.  



  ph.d. thesis  

i spent a lot of time putting up my ph.d. thesis online. as a guest at this
site, it is your moral obligation to check it out! there is a 
 html version  that allows 
selective retrieval of just about any portion you want. you may
also retrieve the  compressed postscript files 
 for individual chapters or the whole thesis.

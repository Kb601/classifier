background


i'm currently a third year graduate student at the  university of washington.
i grew up in istanbul, turkey, received my b.s.e in computer science from 
  princeton university 
in 1993 and am currently working towards a ph.d. on the 
spin
project with 
prof. brian bershad. 


i spent the summer of '93 at 
at&t bell labs
working on the
plan 9
operating system. i helped build a prototype 3-d display during the
summer of '91 at the nec research center 
in princeton, new jersey.
most recently, during the summer of '96, i worked at 
dec src on the
vesta 2 project.

projects


my goal is to develop safe, adaptable and extensible operating systems.
i developed the threads, scheduling, synchronization, ipc, dynamic linking and
protection domain subsystems in spin. i also wrote the machine specific
aspects of the spin kernel, such as the system call and interrupt paths, and
some miscellaneous interfaces, such as alarms and mach compatibility support.

the novel 
aspects of spin threads and scheduling are that they provide the means of
extending a kernel with arbitrary thread implementations and scheduling
policies. dynamically linking the extensions into the kernel allows
us to achieve high-performance. the interface, called strands, is
designed to be safe and provide fault-isolation.

the novel aspect of the 

spin protection domain interface is that it allows
isolation and safe fine-grain sharing at the same time. extensions with
conflicting symbols can be simultaneously active in our system. further, 
extensions can hide some of their code and data such that they can be
assured that no one can possibly access them. the clincher is that extensions
that want to share code and data can do so with no dynamic protection
enforcement overhead.

i also implemented a high-performance
web server on top of the spin networking
stack. the main objectives in its design are reduced http latency and
minimal load.

i wrote a mips instruction set simulator a couple of years ago, called
mipsi,
that was robust enough to simulate all the spec benchmarks and standard ml of
new jersey. it has been used both as an educational tool and as a research
platform. this page describes mipsi's features
and availability.

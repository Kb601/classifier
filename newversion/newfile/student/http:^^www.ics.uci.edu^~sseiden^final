 research 


right now, i'm interested in 
randomized online algorithms.
other interests include

 advanced compiler-compiler tools,
 o(1) space tree traversal,
 minimal perfect hashing,
 anything involving the use of simultaneous equations over finite fields.


here is my 
curriculum vitae.



 abilities 


i've programmed in c, c++, pascal, ada, lisp and various assembly languages.
tools which i've used a lot include mathematica, tex, latex, yacc, and lex.
i've worked on a commercial pascal compiler, so i know
things that no one should about pascal.
i know a little about tcl/tk and html.



theoretical computer science cheat sheet

this consists of ten pages of commonly used formulas and other useful information for computer scientists. i don't guarantee it to be error free,
however,
if you report an error to me by email i'll attempt to correct it as soon as possible.
a
postscript version
is available or you can get the tex source as a
compressed tar archive
.
be forewarned that the tex source is quite messy.
any suggestions from texperts on cleaning it up are welcome.
the program dviconcat is required to typeset the sheet.




available programs


  filledplot.m, 
 isolve.m,
 feasible2d.m:
mathematica packages for solving and plotting inequalities
  nonlinear.m: 
a mathematica package for solving non-linear programs
 
tile: a curses based sliding puzzle solver
 
mel2bib: a melvyl cc to bibtex converter




available papers

the following papers are available in postscript:

 
randomized algorithms for metrical task systems (with sandy irani)
 
a bounded-space tree traversal algorithm (with dan hirschberg)
 
ics-uci tr 92-23: finding succinct ordered minimal perfect hash functions (with dan hirschberg)
 
ics-uci tr 93-30: a cost-effective heuristic storage for minimizing access time of arbitrary data templates (with mayez al-mouhamed)
 
ics-uci tr 93-29: the inverted baseline network and xor-schemes (with mayez al-mouhamed)





 other interests 



road and mountain bike racing. i'm a member of the
cycles veloce cycling team.
 science fiction.
 cooking and eating good food.
 here are my
netscape bookmarks

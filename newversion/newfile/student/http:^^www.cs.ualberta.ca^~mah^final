hi, 

my name is dean mah.  and unfortunately, i'm far from a child prodigy....  
here's a more recent picture of me when i'm all 
growed up.  by including this picture, i am in no way implying that i actually
like it -- the picture or being a grown up!  :p

i am currently (of '94-'95) enrolled at the
university of alberta
studying computer science towards a
master's degree under the supervision of
dr. mark green.

i've just recently moved from 

mackenzie hall a part of

lister hall which is the main undergraduate residences.  now i live in

hub mall but my office is in 

gsb.

and finally i love living in canada, a country where,
the weak and nerdy 
are admired for their computer programming ability.

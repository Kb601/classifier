yet another unnecessary home page




ceci n'est pas une home page.

(well, it's not much of one, anyway.)



i'm not sure how to casually mention my name on my own home page, but
i feel strongly that it should be here, so here it is (in bold, no
less):  doug zongker.



where you can go from here:  (not an exhaustive list)

the usual:
research, publications, etc.
classes
how to contact me

the unusual:
toxic custard workshop files
the mentos gallery
visit the information supercollider

the useless:
today's date ("wasting time with cron")
my cd player database ("wasting time with cgi")
testing grounds (caveat user)





&lt;sarcasm&gt; boy have you got lucky browsing the web today --- a
virtual (pun intended) treasure trove of information, some of which
may be actually useful.  (really!) &lt;/sarcasm&gt; 

i'm a first-year grad student in the computer science & engineering
department at the university of
washington.  i graduated in may 1996 from michigan state university, where i
majored in  computer science and
minored in math.

dubious honors

junior apprentice keeper of the brotherhood of the crouton of death.
carte pizzicato international fan club member 000 0000 5760.
bryan's worst executive vice-president in charge of the emergency backup clicker.




...cruising down the information highway in
high gear...
actually, you're sitting on your butt
staring at a computer screen.



this tasteful background was stolen from the  us department of labor homepage, where
my sister works (the department, not the homepage).

personal information
i am currently a 4th year ph.d. student in computer science at ucsd.  i received my masters
degree in computer science in december 1994 and should qualify before the
end of 1996.

my research interests are in compilers and in applying compiler technology
to software engineering, especially in the analysis of large programs.
more information such as papers and related links can be found in the  software evolution lab's home page.  a
listing of bibliography entries in compilers can be found 
here.


felt
in our spare time, jason gobat and i have written a finite element analysis
package called felt.  here is a description of
the system, as well as pointers to ftp sites with the source code.  felt
also includes a general-purpose drawing
widget that was created for use in the graphical user interface, but
can be used in other applications as well.


useful links
here are some links i find useful personally.  research-related links can
be found on the lab's home page.

my apologies to anyone who expected bells and whistles.  i try to avoid all
the little colored bullets and the like because i like to be able to bring
up my home page without waiting, especially over a slip connection.  if you
want to see color and cool pictures, check out the felt home page.

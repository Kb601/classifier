a msc student in the cs department
    of  university of alberta, edmonton, alberta,
    canada.

  my unofficial research topic: dynamic reverse engineering an
      object-oriented system.  what is that? it is basically to extract
      the design and runtime artifacts of an oo program (java and c++),
      to present it graphically, and to suggest to the users which
      objects/subsystems are good
      candidates for parallelization.
  i am being co-supervised by 
      dr. duane szafron and 
      dr. jonathan schaffer. 


yet another graduate (degree) of carleton university, ottawa, ontario, canada.

  honours project: the sweb project - www server & client in smalltalk
  supervisor: dr. b. n. freeman-benson (now at oti, victoria, canada)

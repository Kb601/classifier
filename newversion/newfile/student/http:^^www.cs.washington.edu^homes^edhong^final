did you know that i'm a second year graduate computer science student
at the university of washington?  well i am.  and that's all i have to
say about that.

for those business type people with little time on their hands, i had
to include my resume link at the top, in postcript
and in plain text form.



my office: room 233 seig hall; (206)543-7798. 
my current home: (206) 244-1261

currently, i'm working with anna karlin and craig chambers on a 
theoretical model for dynamic compilation. more specifically, i'm working
on developing an on-line algorithm that will work well for
dynamic compilation. i plan this to be my quals project.

of various people that i know, on 
another web page.


one of my interests includes keeping up on the computer industry.

of any other such places, please mail 
 me.

liking macs. however, i think better computers that are even
easier to use have yet to come....

 cnn
 apple computer


 
        check the seattle freeway traffic

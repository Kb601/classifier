 family 

my parents, jeanne and
bryan dietz,
live in southern orange county,
california.  my father works for 
sync research, of irvine, california,
as their resident tcp/ip guru.  my mother is
now employed by fhp health care as an ultrasound technician.  both received
bachelors degrees from the 
university of north dakota at grand forks, my father in mechanical
engineering and my mother in speech therapy. 

my sisters are now attending college.  laura is
at stanford university in palo
alto, california, while shelby is at 
cornell university in ithaca, new york. 

here's a picture of my family.

 history 

i was born in a close suburb of minneapolis, minnesota in the winter
of 1973.  nothing really eventful happened, except i almost
electrocuted myself with a christmas tree ornament in 1975.  we spent
six months in montgomery, alabama in 1974-5 and nine in san diego,
california in 1977-8.  this latter stay convinced my mother that she
was tired of snow, and eventually we moved to southern california in
1984.  i have not moved from this area since then. 

i have attended a total of eight elementary and secondary schools, and
so don't feel much attachment to any of them, even the high school
from which i graduated, laguna hills high school in (guess where?)
laguna hills, california.



 aspirations 

 travel 

since i was a young boy, i've been fascinated by space flight.
unfortunately, i have doubts that i'll ever get a chance to ride a
rocket.  in fact, not counting the cities of vancouver, british
columbia and tijuana, baja california, i haven't even left the
country.  i've been through large parts of it on road trips with my
family, though, and very much enjoy seeing the countryside instead of
flying over it.

 employment 

as a grad student, i sometimes think about what life would be like
were i employed.  i'm very glad that there are employment
opportunities in the areas i'm interested in -- it's a shame when
people have to work at jobs that they don't enjoy.  however, i'd also
like to work at a job where i felt i was making a difference in the
world, and being a minion of the 
borg doesn't fit with that ideal.  i feel that i could make the
most effective contribution in the field of os design right now,
because it's what i've been researching for almost a year now, but not
many companies are deploying radically new operating system designs
right now.

current projects



gonna get my phd, i'm a teenage lobotomy.  -- the ramones



i am living on the east coast, about 3000 miles east of seattle, and
working for merl as noted above.  i am currently involved with a project
concerning real-time volume rendering of medical data.


in my copious free time as an expatriate graduate student,
i am working on
chaotic routing
with faculty advisors
 carl ebeling and
 larry snyder.
chaotic routing is a packet routing algorithm for mesh and torus
networks.  my dissertation is on the design and implementation of the
cranium message-passing interface that is compatible
with a network using chaotic routing.
  


past projects

i was a teaching assistant for 

cse 142 in summer 1994.


i designed and implemented a chip tester called the
 mactester.


i was the maintainer for carl's netlist graph isomorphism tool called

gemini.  in industry-speak it is known
as an lvs (layout vs. schematic) tool.  gemini is available by ftp;
if you are interested, please send e-mail to larry mcmurchie

(larry@cs.washington.edu).

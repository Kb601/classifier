sorry!  my home page needs a complete overhaul.  maybe when i get the time..

i am now a grad student at the 
university of california at san diego  
(ucsd)
, working for my master's degree in 
computer science.
  it is nice and sunny here in 
san
diego.


i recently graduated from the 
university of california at
berkeley
 with a b.s. in electrical
engineering & computer science
 with an emphasis in 
computer science
 (phew!).  my undergrad years were fun, but they were a ton of work and
consisted of many, many 
sleepless
nights.

go bears!


i'm still working on this page, and so there isn't much here yet.  but for now, here are some of my www bookmarks.  there's also a meow hidden in this page.

take a look at my personal virtual newspaper.

here are my computer science related links.

here are some people that i know.




things are still a bit messy here.

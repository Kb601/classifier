tim's home (work) page

 greetings... human 

 i suppose you think this web page is under construction. well...
 its not.

 welcome to the home page of one timothy gaastra, cs major by
trade and circumstance. tim was assimilated by the ucr collective in
january of 1996. he is currently being programmed as a master of
computer science, but we are having some trouble rewriting his systems
so that all the information fed to it won't constantly get rerouted to
/dev/null.

 timothy has informed us that prior to his conversion and
retraining he was an "undergrad" at ucla, where he enjoyed such things
as watching "bruins basketball" and going to "cal animage". such
spurious thinking has since been purged from his mind. he has also on
occasion made reference to a affinity for "science fiction" and "computer
games". work is in progress to eliminate this as well.

currently, timothy has been assigned duty as reactor shielding
for the ucr experimental fusion plant. since said project will not
come online until 2030, his current duties allow him to be a system
administrator for the cs department. we have yet to decide whether he
is suited for the application. please forward all bug reports for him
to xyzzy@saucer.area51.mil.

 for those of you looking for timely info and who do not wish uninvited visits from military police, we direct you to query the subject directly at:

gaastra@cs.ucr.edu or
gaastra@empirenet.com

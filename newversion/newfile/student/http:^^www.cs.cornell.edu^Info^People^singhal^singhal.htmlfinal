my research interests are in the area of information retrieval and
text processing. my thesis advisor was (late) prof. gerard
salton. my current thesis supervisors are dr. chris buckley and prof. claire
cardie

here is a postscript copy of my resume.

the smart group at cornell cs department has been
one of the foremost research groups in the field of information
retrieval for last thirty years. our current research involves:


document length normalization in information retrieval

 to fairly retrieve texts of varying sizes, document length
normalization is commonly used in term weighting. we show that
effective systems should retrieve documents of all sizes with chances
similar to their likelihood of relevance. we propose pivoting,
a new technique that can be used to modify existing normalization
functions to yield substantial improvements in retrieval
effectiveness. we also propose a new and effective normalization
technique.some papers ...

our trec
participation

text retrieval conference (trec) is a nist and arpa co-sponsored
effort to objectively evaluate various information retrieval
techniques on an independent testbed. the smart system has
consistently been one of the best systems at trec.some
papers ...

automatic text structuring and summarization

non expository texts are not usually read from cover to
cover. readers are helped in such circumstances by providing selective
access to text excerpts as needed. we have developed techniques to
analyze the structure of a text and provide tools for selective text
traversal.some papers ...

amit singhal, ph.d. student;
mandar mitra, ph.d. student;
david fielding, masters of engineering student;

and others as the group slowly fluctuates.

i'm working on the dynamic compilation project.  the dynamic compiler
is a beast that generates/optimizes code at runtime. in the short
term, i'm interested in figuring out how to produce good code 
dynamically  (i.e. at runtime) for modern processor architectures. on the applications side, i think interpreter-based
systems with real-time constraints, like the hot java web browser, can
benefit from selective runtime compilation. i'd like to wire up such a
system to a runtime compiler and see how it goes. i'm working with
professors  susan eggers
and   craig chambers.

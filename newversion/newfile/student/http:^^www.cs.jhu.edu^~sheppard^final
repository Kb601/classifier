currently, i am a graduate student in the johns hopkins department of
computer science, finishing up my ph.d.  i am writing my thesis on
memory-based reinforcment learning applied to solving differential
games (keep checking back for a downloadable copy).  since i am
attempting to solve the games (i.e., figure out 
game values and optimal strategies for "both" players), my research
takes me into the realm of multi-agent learning, meaning all players
are learning simultaneously. some of the early results of my research
can be found in the list of papers.



in addition to working on my ph.d., i am also employed as a principal
research analyst at arinc incorporated.  my research at arinc is quite
different from the work here at hopkins.  at arinc, i am responsible for
ir&d (independent research and development) activities in the areas of
intelligent test, diagnosis, and network fault management.  my publications
in these areas are much more extensive than the list shown here.  
unfortunately,
only a few of those papers are available electronically.  people interested in
receiving a list of my publications in test and diagnosis should contact
me at any of the above arinc addresses.



another responsibility of mine at arinc is active participation in
professional societies and standards writing bodies, namely the ieee, aaai,
ieee standards activities, and
the iec. in particular, i am the 
ieee computer society liaison to ieee standards coordinating committee 20
(scc20).  scc20 is responsible for writing several standards related to
electronics testing (e.g., atlas, abbet, and ai-estate).  i am also the
co-chair of the 
ai-estate (artificial intelligence exchange and service tie
to all test environments) data and knowledge representation working
group.  recently, i was appointed by the
ieee computer society
tttc (test technology technical committee), which is responsible
for the 1149 standards (e.g., boundary scan), to co-chair the tttc
system test tac (technical activity committee). 



also, i have been
appointed by the tttc to the test technology standards committee.
finally, i have been given the distinct honor of being named a
u.s. delegate to the iec/tc93 plenary meeting in copenhagen. tc93 is
the technical committee for design automation, working on standards
such as edif and vhdl. tc93 recently formed a new working group (wg7)
for test and is working to "fast-track" several standards from the
ieee to become iec standards. the first will be atlas. of particular
interest to me is ai-estate which is being proposed as a joint iec/iso
standard.

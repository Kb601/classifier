aloha from yellowstone.


i received my 
 b.s.
(1985) and
 m.s.
(1995) degrees from usm,
and i'm attending tulane
university's
phd program in computer science
in the murder capital of all of god's creation,
 new orleans.

here are some of my computer science related
publications, and here are some
 quotes and 
 opinions, even on 
operating sytems.
if you wish,
take a gander at my resume.


i've toiled in the computer industry, everywhere from
the friendly company swallowed by the death star at&amp;t/mccaw
 to the makers of the 
fastest 
chip in the world with the worst marketing,
digital.




before i shattered my
tibia in a 
wreck (caused by a wrong way, hit-and-run driver), i rode a
lot. here, i'm in front of the golden gate on my 1984 
honda nighthawk cb750sce.
this pic was taken on a road trip from tijuana to vancouver up pch.
thanks to fieldsheer and 
agv for saving
my skin and my skull, thanks to howard for the
bike, and thanks to steve and ed for dragging me out of the road.  don't dress
for the ride, dress for the crash.

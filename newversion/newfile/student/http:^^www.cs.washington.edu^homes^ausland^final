about me ...

i'm a phd hopeful at:

department of computer science and engineering
at the university of washington.  



here's a picture of the spring 1996 computer animation class. click on
it for the original.

 
 



last quarter i completed my quals project: 

run time code generation under the multiflow compiler.

my 

resume .

i've written the following papers:

 
 fast, effective dynamic compilation,
 j. auslander, m. philipose, c. chambers, s.j. eggers and
b.n. bershad. pldi '96
 
 automatic dynamic compilation support for event dispatching in
extensible systems,
 c. chambers, s.j. eggers, j. auslander, m. philipose, m. mock and
p. pardyak. 
workshop on compiler
support for systems software (february 1996)
 
 further experience with controller-based automatic motion synthesis
for articulated figures,
 j. auslander, a. fukunaga, h. partovi, j.
christensen, l. hsu, p. reiss, a. shuman, j.  marks, j.t. ngo, acm
transactions on graphics (vol. 14 no. 4, pages 311--336)
 this paper also has a web site. 


"optimal leapfrogging", j. auslander, a. t. benjamin,
d. s. wilkerson. mathematics magazine (vol. 66 no. 1, pages
14-19, 1993).


here is a (very lossily compressed)
mpeg animation
that goes with the motion synthesis paper. the last sequence shows my
work: how the computer can piece together some cartwheels, a jump, and
shuffle into an animation without having the figure fall down and
collapse. the brown figure is using my algorithm, the orange figure is
just trying to to switch between motions without any consideration to
smoothness or physics.

autumn '95 i took 
557
and did the super-short animation,
"bug"
(or try
"this"
double speed small version)
for my final project.

until i find a better place for them, here are some 
slides 
from the
talk on singular value decomposition i gave in the graphics seminar
(590b).

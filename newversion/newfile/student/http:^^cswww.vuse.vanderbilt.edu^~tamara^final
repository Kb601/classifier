personal information
i am a graduate student in the department of computer science
 at vanderbilt university.  

  i received my b.s. in computer science from university of novi sad, 
yugoslavia, and my m.s. degree in computer science from middle tennessee state university.
my master's thesis, "stretched avl-trees" was done under the advisory of
dr. thomas cheatham.

my primary interest at vanderbilt is in artificial intelligence. 
 specifically, i am intrigued by the effects of mixing different areas of
 artificial intelligence with cognitive science. i am also interested in neural networks, machine learning,  data mining, 
parallel (distributed) programming, some areas of software engineering and the theory of computer science.


my hobbies include working out, playing tennis, reading, hanging out with my friends...

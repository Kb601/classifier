computer scientists with x-rays of their limbs on the web:


 ted romer's knee after 
arthroscopic surgery.

 mark hill's wrist.




my friend dylan
said his hair couldn't be cut with a flowbee.  we said it could.  being
experimental scientists, we conducted an experiment.  you can judge the 
results yourself.


after attending isca '95, i travelled in europe and took some
pictures.

 romer, v. tr.  to eat

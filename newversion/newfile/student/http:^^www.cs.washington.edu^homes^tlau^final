 just another dead end on the information superhighway. 






i'm a second-year
graduate student in computer science at the university of washington.  
my research interests include a mix of ai, ui, and all sorts of web-related
goodies.  i'm currently working on clio, a system for searching and
browsing one's personal web history.  no, it's not available yet.


i'm not currently seeking gainful employment, but my
resume is online for the curious.




my kitty
i have the honor of sharing an apartment with 
gambit, a siamese mix.  


cats are great.



more about me
more information about me can be found here.  there
are some pictures of me 
here, here, and here.  there's a page on where to
find me.  apparently, i'm also
really interested in scotland.

i'm still working on my quals, and this quarter i'm taking the last two of
eight classes to fulfill the breadth requirement.

tome, which is committed to the advancement of linux as a pretty cool
gaming platform.


there's also my first attempt at java programming, a simple maze applet.  see also java for linux.



what i do when i'm not sleeping
i've been known to frequent seattle area bookstores.

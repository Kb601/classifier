	i also have a
	personal
	web page.
      

      
      
	i'm an active member of the
	
	  computer systems laboratory,
	working on a novel operating system abstraction.
      
      
	i believe it is possible to design an efficient kernel that also
	gives extreme design flexibility to os designers and user-level
	programmers.  operating systems are large complex systems, and
	should be able to leverage on technologies and techniques
	currently available for large complex user-level programs.
	however, this must be done without sacrificing performance.
      
      
	some other projects working on similar themes are:
	
	  flux,
	
	  exokernel,
	
	  l3 and l4,
	
	  cache kernel, and
 	
	  spin.
	a good place to find information about current operating system
	projects is
	
	  here.
      

      
	with this group, i'm also interested in developing a research
	agenda dealing with the issues of resource identification and
	authentification in a mobile wireless environment.
      

      
	you can see me say the same thing in my
	
	  1995 research summary.
      

      
      
	i have strong interests in human factors and software
	engineering, and believe that computer scientists should spend
	more time thinking about people than they do.
      

      
	in my spare time (ha ha ha), i'm interested in linguistics.
	over the years, i've shifted from "computational natural
	language processing" to "human language comprehension by
	humans".  second language learning currently attracts me here.
      

      
      
	to help remember when various interesting talks are on campus,
	i've begun to organize the seminar announcements for a few
	groups.  for example, you can find the current
	
	  ucsd ai research group
	listings.  other groups can be found 
	
	  here.
	if you have any suggestions, comments or want your favorite
	research group's seminar schedule available, send some
	email.
      
      
      
      
	i'm hoping to get around to entering bibliography information on
	the 300+ papers currently sitting in my bedroom.  of course, i'd
	rather not do this, so if you know of good locations for me to
	obtain this information already in computer format, i'll take
	you to lunch or something.

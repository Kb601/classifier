 eric siegel      man's best friend

 i am a graduate student in the 
computer science department  at columbia university  in  new york city .  i am doing a
thesis on  natural
language processing   with kathleen r. mckeown.  my other major
interest is genetic algorithms, so i use them for natural language.

i maintain a genetic
programming brainstorming archive created by the participants of
the aaai symposium on genetic programming, fall 1995.

also, here are my opinions on how to write a paper
for gp.

 my homepage is lame, but my friend alex chaffee says everything else i want
to say about genetic programming and stuff, and lars likes it anyway.

you can send me email.


 "wow, this is some kind of genetic algorithm!" says kelly lynch in
"virtuousity," starring denzel washington.

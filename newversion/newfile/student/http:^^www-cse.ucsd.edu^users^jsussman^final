whole internet thang, so i expect my home page will get more
interesting as time goes on.

of computer science  at the university of california, 
san diego.  my 
advisor (yes, i do have one) is  
keith marzullo, with whom i am doing work on distributed systems.  
i'd like to be more specific, but i'm not there yet.  
it looks like it will be involved in the 
serrano
project.
keep your fingers crossed. 
meanwhile, these are the conferences and
classes that mean
something to me these days.

more info

before i made the big leap to 

graduate school, i was a 
beer drinker in
new york city, which
is a habit i learned while at college.
actually, if you went to
princeton
as well, you might be interested in
the princeton alumni council.

i got 
married
.
twice.



here's a connection to my 
mother-in-law
 (she's the first picture). 


i still work for 
seer technologies, on the 
freeway
team.  need proof that
we're actually making useful stuff?  check out this press release.

i am now one of the administrators of 
chez bob.
of course, there's more to life than serving others.  around here, we
try to entertain ourselves:
concerts,
cds,
sports,
t.
v.,
movies,
biking,
learning about stuff,
even local 
touristy traps!  and of course, reading dilbert.

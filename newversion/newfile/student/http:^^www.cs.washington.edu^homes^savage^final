after sampling the rich post-industrial culture of modern pittsburgh
for six years, i caught a ride with the 1993 bershad migration and i'm
now a gradual student of the first rank here at uw.  my strong
background in 19th and 20th century american history provides me with
a firm, yet irrelevant, platform from which to "trash talk" my peers:
"any fool can see that de tocqeuville's statement,
'[americans] find it a tiresome inconvenience to exercise
political rights which distract them from industry' is quite similar to
current microprocessor architectural trends favoring the needs of
application code over operating systems"


i work with brian bershad  
and the rest of the  merry band on
an operating system project called spin. 

projects

spin
spin is an extensible operating system omnifemtokernel which
supports the dynamic adaptation of system interfaces and
implementations through direct application control, while still
maintaining system integrity and inter-application isolation.

mike van wie's urcs home page

 


would you buy a used car from this man?



, just a short time ago,
i was a mild-mannered programmer, counting the hours until payday, investing
my time in such vital concerns as sleeping, eating, and watching
major league baseball.  sadly, those days are gone.  now they call me:

mike van wie, urcs grad student
and i spend most of my time trying not to work on my web page.  alas,
i couldn't avoid it forever, and when not one but two first-year
students finished theirs, i was finally shamed into writing this.
oh, it's modest yet, and i'm still getting the hang of working with html.
but soon -- soon -- i'll have a real web page.  

and then you'll all be sorry.

  hierarchical learning of reactive behaviors (ieee int. conf. on systems, man, & cybernetics 1995)
  
perceptual homing using self-organizing networks (proc. of world congress on neural networks 1995)

    maturity begins when we are content to feel we are right about 
   something,
    
    &nbsp &nbsp 
   without feeling the necessity to prove someone else wrong.
   
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    about myself 
     
    
    academics  
     
    
     
     interests
    
     
    

  
  if you love something set it free.
  
  if it comes back to you, it is yours forever,

else it was never yours to begin with.

personal interests


   science fiction and fantasy, written and otherwise.  in
       fact, i should probably be honest and identify the above illustration.
       it's merlin, the son of corwin (pictured
       here), who is a favorite fictional
       character of mine from roger
       zelazny's chronicles of amber.  the image was taken from the
       amber drpg published by phage press, which i would recommend to anyone
       who likes the books.  also, i recommend the tv series babylon 5.
       
       
   creative writing, both fiction and poetry (no, there will be
       absolutely no links here to any of my work!).
       
       
   athletics.  in no particular order:
       
	  tennis 
	  tae 
	      kwon do
	  distance running
       
       
       
   role-playing.
       

   random other things, depending on the day.  cats.




random other things...



   go to the homepage of my friend and fellow williams alumnus
       sean sandys. 

   look! up on the web!  it's a woman!  it's
       a dog!  no, it's former cse grad student
       wendy
       belluomini dressed up as dogbert!
       
       
   a lot of people have asked me if theory is a worthwhile area
       of research, or whether it's too abstract to be useful.
       
       here is a better explanation of the goals and future of
       theory than i've ever given them.

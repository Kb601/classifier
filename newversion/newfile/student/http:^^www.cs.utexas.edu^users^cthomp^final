i am participating in a candlelight vigil across the internet
to help increase awareness of violence against women.


research

my current research interests in artificial intelligence are primarily
in the area of machine learning.  specifically, i am interested
in natural language acquisition.  
learning to produce a deep semantic
representation from an input sentence would be useful in many tasks.
my ph.d. proposal is on corpus-based lexical acquisition.
i wrote my master's thesis 
on a system which learned rules suitable for use in a diagnostic expert 
system. 
i am also interested in mobile robots, and had an exhibit at
robofest 5 in 1994.  in the spring semester of 1995, i was the ta for 
"building intelligent agents".
here's my finger information,
 a picture of me, my vita, 
 and a list of my publications.
also, see 
the machine learning page 
for more information on our group.

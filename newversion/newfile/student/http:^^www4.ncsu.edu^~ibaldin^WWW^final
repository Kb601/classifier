  to

ilia's home page


finally, after much delay, i have hurled myself onto the www bandwagon and
created my own  homepage.



it has taken me a while for several reasons. one of them is i didn't feel 
comfortable typing up my autobiography and calling it my home page. 
now, that i got some substance, i have committed myself to creating
this document.


here is a brief list of things you can find on this page:

 personal stuff 
 my research and academic interests, 
publications 
 my resume 
 sites in russia 
 my hobbies 

	 linux 
	 photography 
	 aikido 
	 pinky and the brain (zort!)
	 babylon 5 

 my e-mail address 





first, about myself. my name, as follows from the title, is ilia (pronounced
[ily'a]), last name is baldine ([bahldin]). 
there is a story behind this strange spelling, but i'd rather keep it to 
myself.
i am a graduate student at the north carolina state university's 
 department of computer science. 




academic interests and publications
my m.s. thesis was on multicast routing algorithms. presently my work is 
centered around single-hop optical networks, but i also find interesting
the following areas:

atm networks. 

 atm forum 
 ip over atm resource page

 wireless networks 
 network protocols and security 

ipng
ietf home page
directory of rfc



you can find the list of my publications  here .



russia
i am russian, and if you are interested in exploring russia without leaving
the comfort of your room, this is a good 
 place  to start. it contains
links to many sites in russia, plus volumes of information about the history 
and the current events in the former soviet union. it even has a pointer to 
mikhail gorbachev's homepage.

here is a list of other interesting web sites in or about russia:

 open media research institute (affiliated
with radio free europe)
 radio free europe/radio liberty
 russia on the net 
 moscow state university , where i 
studied for several years
 a mouse-sensitive map,
which contains pointers to a lot of web sites in russia





hobbies




linux

linux is a unix-like pc operating system. i have a linux box at home. you 
can either see the  
specs  for my system, or you can browse a 
 list  of linux-related sites. 
 if you have no idea what linux is all about but are curious to find out,
try  here .




photography
i am something of an amateur photographer. in the past few years i've taken
many many pictures in different parts of this country. i have chosen about
a dozen, that i like a lot, and scanned them in. they fall in two categories:
one that i call "my photogallery", which is a collection with no
particular theme or order, the other one is from my recent trip to yellowstone.
enjoy!

aikido












i started practicing aikido in '94 and the more i do it, the more i like it. 
with time i will be adding some interesting aikido-related links here. for
now you have a choice of visiting ncsu aikido club 
home-page 
or sending an 
e-mail 
to the ncsu aikido list, whose subscribers are mostly members of the 
aforementioned club.

robert p. bland iii




personal information
i am a graduate student in the department of computer science at vanderbilt university.  i will be graduating in may and will begin working for issc, a subsidiary company of ibm.  in 1994 i received my b.a. in mathematics from hendrix college, a small liberal arts school in conway, ar.

my primary interest at vanderbilt is in software engineering.  specifically, i am intrigued by the effects of the object-oriented paradigm on software.  my current m.s. research is on sun microsystem's new object-oriented language java.  my m.s. paper is titled "a translation from c++ to java."  i am a member of sdg++, a weekly discussion group on current topics in software engineering.

my hobbies include computers (imagine that!), television, movies, classical music, billy joel, disney, travel, and most sports.  i also really enjoy roller coasters.  the hangman at opryland u.s.a. here in nashville is a great ride!

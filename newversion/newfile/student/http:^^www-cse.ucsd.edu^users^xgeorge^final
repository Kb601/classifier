brief c.v.

i have been a student of the athens 
university of economics and
business (athens, greece) from october 1989 until june 1993,
in the department 
of informatics, from where i
received my diploma in informatics (computer
science). since october 1994, i am a
graduate student and researcher in the university of
california, san diego, in the 
computer science and engineering
department. i got a m.s. degree in computer science in
winter 1996 and i am currently working towards a ph.d. degree.
for the 1996-97 academic year, i am supported by a 
national semiconductor
corporation graduate fellowship.

among other things, i have been employed as a translator of
computer related books during 1992, as an instructor in
computer training seminars during the second half of 1993,
and as a teaching assistant during the second half of 1994 and
most of 1995. my present occupation as a graduate researcher
involves several aspects of computer network architecture and
design. for more details, you should look at my research page,
which is located in the web server of my research home, the
computer systems
laboratory, where i am the systems and networks
administrator since january 1996. as an alternative, you can
directly jump to a (partial) list of my 
publications 
that are available on line.

out-of-band interests

the 
monty python comedy troupe
(silliness as an art form), from bonni hall.
contains links to just about everything on the web about flying
circus, the movies, the books, the fan-clubs. also, links to 
information on 
british comedy from cathouse.org: 
practically every british comedy show you may have ever come
across is there.

tex and latex: everything you need is on the ctan archives.
my favorites are the extensions for multilingual support on the pc
based versions. here is the link to the 
united states
site of ctan (comprehensive tex archives network).
look under 
systems 
for tex versions for various platforms and
under 
language
for multilingual support. i suggest using 
emtex 
for the pc and
greektex
for greek language support on the pc and elsewhere. 



brief advertisement

have you been to greece recently? at all? 
for general information click
here,
or click
here for information 
on the hellenic discussion list,
news from greece on the net and some great pictures. and take
some advice from someone who has been there: don't stay in
athens long, it's dangerous for your physical and mental
health. now, mykonos, there is a good option...



current news on the hellas list (to be removed)

the famous hellas list has made the press again. this time, it
is an article in "ta nea" which brings forward...the greek
presence in cyberspace! if you can read
elot 928 greek, you can get a complete and unabridged version
of the 
article,
including the photographs, or my 
commented
version. there are also greeklish versions of the
article
and my 
comments.

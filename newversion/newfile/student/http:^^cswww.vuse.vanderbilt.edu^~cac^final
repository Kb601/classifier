(peg) which works in conjunction with 
oak ridge national lab 
(ornl) on the early evaluation
of systems.
i received a b.s. degree in computer science
from the
 
university of tennessee at knoxville   in
1988.
i completed my m.s. degree in computer science 
in 1994 here at vanderbilt university.
from 1988 until 1994 i was employed at the ibm software

my dissertation topic is in the area of parallel i/o
workload characterization and the optimization of
raid performance.
i am also working on performance supplement textbooks and their
solutions sets: 
 p.s. to operating systems,
 solutions to p.s. to operating systems (both available from prentice
hall), and
 p. s. to computer architecture (coming soon), jointly
sponsored by cmg and acm/sigmetrics.

welcome to david cassel's home page!

i am a graduate student here at northeastern university, in the
college of computer science.  very soon, i'll be graduating with a
master's degree, and moving back to the philadelphia area.

when i graduate, i'll be going to work for lockheed martin in valley forge, pa
as a software engineer.

by some miracle, i have finished everything!  i'm done!  i'm no
longer a student, but somehow i've managed to find ways to fill my
time.  i can deal with this.  

how about some miscelaneous fun stuff.

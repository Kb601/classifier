they are playing a game. they are playing at not playing a game.

	i shall break the rules and they will punish me. 
i must play their game, of not seeing i see the game. --r. d. laing

about myself and mine 

 
 
let me have my own way, 
let others promulge the laws, i will make no account of the laws, 
let others praise eminent men and hold up peace, 
		i hold up agitation and conflict, 
i praise no eminent man, i rebuke to his face the one that was thought most
		worthy. 
--after i wrote this lines, 
i realized that i was plagiarized 136 years ago by w. whitman.

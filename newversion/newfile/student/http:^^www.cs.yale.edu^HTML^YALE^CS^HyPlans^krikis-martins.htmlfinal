martins' krikis home page






welcome to the home page of
martins krikis



this little image here should remind you that this home-page will
never be finished. 



below you should find all the info necessary to visit
and/or contact me. there are also some clues about when not to.


my  mailing address: 



yale university 
department of computer science 
p.o. box 208285 
new haven, ct 06520-8285




my  shipping address: 



yale university 
department of computer science 
51 prospect st. 
new haven, ct 06520-8285




the physical location where i spend most of my time is
 office 403  in  akw  (aka "watson"). 


the  phone number  there is  (203)-432-6495. 


with the help of the unix  finger  
function it is generally possible to make rather
intelligent guesses about whether i am in my office or not.
a closer look at the data required to make such a prediction
is available by clicking 

right here. 


sending me  email  is a potentially dangerous step.
you should not even consider it unless you know what is 
"net-etiquette" and how to comply with it. in particular,
if you want to offer me or "my company" the goods or 
services of yourself, your company, your webpage or whatever,
then don't bother. instead you may mail your message 
straight to your postmaster---that way it will get there
faster and will waste much less bandwidth. if you want to 
share with me your discovery about making $50,000 a month,
please inform the postmaster first and send a copy to the irs
as well. thank you.


having said this, the address is here, use at your own risk:
  krikis@cs.yale.edu  


now here are some links, nothing outrageous yet, but i'm working on them:

  
     the home page of my wife liga 
  
     links to documents more on the serious side 
 
     links to images, trip reports and other fun stuff 
 
     links to information about latvia 
 
     links to people i know outside of this department 
  
     links to all kinds of places 
  
     (back to) other graduate students

oh yes, you should've taken that left turn at albuquerque!


 no point kidding myself. with the
cute icon, you'd probably think somebody's working on this page. but no! i
can't be bothered to do that! sometimes, i get sick of seeing the same lame
page over and over, so i rearrange it a little, rewrite this blurb, change the
nice pic, and voila! a fresh new page. aaaaaah....


while you're holding your breath waiting for this work of art, why don't you
take a look at some of my friends' pages? here's a quick list:



captain nemo's
gateway to galactic goings-on!

 fox's
netbsd propaganda.

 
jetset's fat-free page.

 
chuckies' tribute to minimalism.

 tyler's
pleasure principle.

 
simon's ecstatic trance port.

 
mappy's repository of
samples from his
excellent but still anonymous band.

 more to come!...

 research interests 

 
	mobile robot exploration, map learning and navigation.
 
	intelligent control. 

my ph.d. research work
is primarily on the spatial semantic hierarchy approach to mobile
robot exploration, map learning and navigation. 





 other interests 

software engineering and development in areas ranging from


 
artificial intelligence including machine learning, neural networks,
qualitative reasoning and machine vision, 


 
operating system, networking system, embedded system and graphical user interface to 


 
multimedia.

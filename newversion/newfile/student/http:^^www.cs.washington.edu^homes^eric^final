 why this page is no longer black
 in honor of the recent (june 12)
decision
in aclu v. reno, this page is no longer black.  mind you, the
decision is merely an interim step (you could read my 
take on it), so i'm probably still committing a 
felony.
(and so should we all, if we care about speech and freedom and the
marketplace of ideas.)


 facts about me 


i'm a third-year graduate student in computer science.  that means i
mostly panic about my quals project.



i'm also trying to write some papers with 
prof. henry greenside
of duke university
(and recently finished a 
master's thesis 
by myself) on
steady-state solutions of a particular nonlinear biharmonic pde.
because the stability criterion for explicit methods is so restrictive
(a fourth power of the spatial resolution), implicit timestepping
methods such as backwards euler are necessary.  the numerical analysis
issues involve newton's method for solving the implicit nonlinear
equations, sparse matrix solution methods for solving for the newton
step, and some interplay between them.

and the pictures   can be really spiffy.


i'm working on an n-body code for 
astrophysics simulation.  this work is in 
support of a project on 
data structures
by prof. richard anderson


i'm working on a signal processing/computer music 
project aiming at automatic 
transcription from an acoustic signal.  prof.
anna karlin is
the musician who got me interested in this project.


 like everybody else, i've got a page of 
applets.  (this first link is just text and small graphics.)
section material on c++ that i prepared
for cse
143 last fall. 
-->


like everybody else, i've got a page of 
snapshots, mostly family.  (i can now prove i've got all those brothers.)


 finally, here's the weather in seattle.

jason's homepage


you can grab the latest version of my .emacs (v0.95) (emacs
configuration) if you'd like.  it's kinda big though (492+k).  so if you
want to just poke around the individual directories,
feel free.  note, i don't always make a new tar file everytime i edit my
.emacs, so you may want to check the version number in my .emacs itself, and bug me to make a new tar file.

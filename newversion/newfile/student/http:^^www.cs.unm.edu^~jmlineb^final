i work at sandia national laboratories
in the synthetic environment lab, 
doing virtual-reality visualization programming in 
c/c++ and 
opengl on high-end
silicon graphics
(sgi) workstations that have far more main memory that i do.  my professional
interests include software architecture, software engineering, 
object-oriented 
analysis, design, and programming, and enterprise data modeling.  
(in fact, i put myself through college as a data model.)  

i am pursuing a master's degree in the  
computer science program at the 
university of new mexico (unm) under sandia's university
part-time (upt) program.  upt allows me to attend classes and study for 20 hours
a week, work part-time for 20 hours a week, and remain a full-time
sandia employee.  what a deal!  i am scheduled to graduate in december 1997. 
a phd in computer science is in my future, but so is a life ... 

i live in cedar crest,
new mexico, on a ridge at about 7100 feet 
with a great view of the east face of the
sandia mountains.
i play
classical guitar, 
enjoy 
hiking, camping, and 
whitewater canoeing, 
spend far more time hacking 
linux than i should,
and only date women who run 32-bit operating systems.  
i have just started 
mountain biking 
in order to get swimsuit-compatible for the summer.

"nothing feels better against your skin than software."

for some reason.

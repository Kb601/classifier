emersons' law of contrariness:

our chief want in life is somebody who shall make us do what we can.  
having found them, we shall then hate them for it.


or, of course, you could just read all the quotes at once
just in case you didn't notice, i'm reorganizing this page... bear 
with me... :)

hello, and welcome to my home page, located in sunny 
downtown baltimore maryland.  thank you, 
thank you.
up until very recently, this page was located in the rather revolting 
city of newark, new 
jersey, which is not only the the car theft capital
of the eastern seaboard, but now (as of this year) the murder capital 
of america.  i must confess to a certain perverse pride in that fact...


"so, (i hear you ask), how did you manage to extricate yourself from that 
wonderful 3-ring circus of a city?"  well, you see, it 
all starts with a cow....

i usually use the sun box that some call
&quot;osprey&quot; (but i call &quot;walrus&quot;) on campus, and
you can finger me there
to see if i'm around. 

anyway, this being the world wide 
web and all, i guess i am supposed to give you a whole load of 
details about my life with a slew of more-or-less on-topic links to 
hither and yon.
so... without further ado:



me, myself, and i


weird jobs i have held

i have been a puppeteer, makeup artist, cinematographer,
projectionist, steadicam operator, and occasional groucho marx
impersonator in woody allen plays.  ain't life fun? 




jewish stuff, including my illustrious next door 
neighbor and the the baltimore shabbat clock.












computer stuff:






books




  

music









last, but not least, fun places to visit!


i hereby decree that the oo 
pages are completely and utterly inherently cool[tm].

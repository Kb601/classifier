this homepage undergoing vast renovations!  stay tuned...
this will never be done, to be totally honest...

here's some graphic.  actually, this is me, only it's not terribly
recognizable...
 

stuff that's interesting

well, i've been until last year a computer science student back at ub
(the university at buffalo).  now i'm doing graduate work at william and mary in williamsburg,
virginia... 

i also work at vims, the college's virginia institute of marine science,
in the computer center there. 

i'm a dj for a progressive rock radio show called 
sleepless. 

here's some stuff about satisfying my various creative urges. :)

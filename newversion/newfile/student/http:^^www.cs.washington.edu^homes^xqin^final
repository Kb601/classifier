i am a 5th year graduate student working with  

jean-loup baer. 
my research interests include computer architectures,
parallel and distributed systems, 
performance evaluation methods such as modeling and simulation.  
my short term goal is to get out of school as soon as possible. 

 papers: 

a performance evaluation of cluster-based architectures, 
qin and baer, submitted to a conference.



on the use and performance of explicit communication
primitives in cache-coherent multiprocessor systems, 
qin and baer, to appear in the proceedings of hpca-3.



a comparative study of conservative and 
optimistic trace-driven simulations, 
qin and baer,  an award paper in 1995 simulation symposium, page 42-50.



optimistic trace-driven simulation, 
qin and baer, tech report 94-10-03, dept of computer science and engineering, 
univ. of washington. 


 
a parallel trace-driven  simulator: implementation and performance, 
qin and baer,  in proceedings of 1994 international conference 
of parallel processing, page 314-318.



min-graph: a tool
for monitoring and visualizing min-based
multiprocessor performance, 
zhang, nalluri, and qin, 
 in journal of parallel and distributed computing, 
june 93, page 231-241.



performance prediction and evaluation of parallel processing
on a numa multiprocessor, 
zhang and qin,  in ieee trans. on software engineering, 
oct 91, page 1059-68.

 welcome to my www homepage. you are the th visitor since mar 20, 96. 


 research 

i am interested in modeling cortical structures in neural networks.
currently, i am working on a hand-written digit recognition system
based on lateraly interconnected synergetically self organizing feature map(lissom:developed by
 joseph sirosh and 
 prof. risto miikkulainen  
at  utcs neural networks research 
group . recent work includes extending the lissom model to have actual
spiking events. the new model called spiking lissom (slissom) can be
self-organized as lissom and can segment multiple objects in the retina
by synchronizing spikes within a group representing the same object,
and desynchronizing spikes between groups representing different objects.

 my research outline.

miikkulainen and joseph sirosh :  lateral interactions in the cortex: structure and function

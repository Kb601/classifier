research

control knowledge improves the performance of a problem solver by
guiding it to more efficient and accurate solutions. my research
involves using a combination of analytical and inductive machine
learning techniques to acquire this control information.  i am
particularly interested in using such methods to improve the
performance of planning and scheduling systems. for more information,
i have included a detailed  description of my
research, my  vita, and a  list of publications. also, check out the 
machine learning research group page.

welcome to my home page. i am a grad student at socs, the  school of computer science, mcgill. i am currently working on my master's thesis which is about locating faces in images using color and shape. this is part of a broader research done by prof. martin levine at cim, the  center for intelligent machines,  electrical engineering department, mcgill. prof. levine (cim) is my supervisor and prof. greg dudek (socs) is my co-supervisor. i started my research this february after
two weeks of discussions on the topic of face recognition and neural networks with prof. kountchev, an old professor of mine at the technical university of sofia, bulgaria.

 research interests 


 concurrency theory
 most of my research has been in testing theory for real-time systems.
more recently i have been working on testing equivalences for pict, a 
concurrent object-oriented language based on the pi-calculus. 
 model-checking for real-time and probabilistic systems
 
 scheduling theory
 while this is not something i am actively studying as part of my thesis
research, 
i did spend the summer of 1996 working at rome laboratory doing research in this area.




 personal: 
this seems to be the section where everyone mentions the far-away places 
that they call home. well 
i'm a native baltimorean so obviously i didn't stray too far from home
when i chose jhu. i actually grew up in linthicum (12 miles to the south,
where the airport is).
my high school, archbishop spalding h.s., has its own homepage.
i managed to get a little farther away from home for college.
i graduated in 1991 from randolph-macon college in ashland, virginia with a degree in
computer science
and mathematics.

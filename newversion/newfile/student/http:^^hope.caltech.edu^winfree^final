                  research

my current project concerns dna-based computers.  

there's not much to say about my robotics 
research.
                  other stuff

with  kurt
fleischer and other folk in the  computer graphics lab i made a
single-image random dot stereogram (sirds) animation, which was shown
at siggraph 94.  i collected a few frames
together.  some of this stuff went in a book by chris watkins of
 algorithm inc.

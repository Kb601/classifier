research interests:

 shared-memory multiprocessing & scalable coherent interface (sci)
 cache design
 aspects of parallelism in processor-in-memory (or memory-in-processor) architectures (galileo)
 

research summary:

in 1994 i have introduced the glow kiloprocessor extensions to sci (a.k.a. hierarchical extensions sci) in collaboration
with jim goodman. i am now working to both examine in depth design options and develop the upcoming 1596.2 standard in
colaboration with jim goodman, david v. james and stein gjessing.

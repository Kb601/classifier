background

i'm a graduate student at the university of washington in the department of computer science and engineering.  i grew
up in germany (near düsseldorf), and spent a few years in high
school in princeton, nj.  i received a b.a. in computer science from
rutgers university in 1992 and spent several summers at at&t bell labs and the mitre corporation working on a range of
projects.  i'm the sole proprietor of mef systems, a company
that i created in december 1993 to sell a distributed, fault tolerant,
ip network based telephone system that i built from scratch on a set
of vme chasis with 680x0 processors, using univoice telephone interface cards
and the vxworks operating system.


most of my time i spend hacking on spin, which is
a safe, adaptable and extensible operating system.

my primary contribution to spin is an extensible protocol architecture for
application-specific networking.  applications achieve compelling
performance improvements using our new structure, when compared to
similar applications running on dec's commercial osf/1 v3.2 platform.

recent reports and papers

 

 an extensible protocol architecture for
application-specific networking 
 a design and implementation and performance paper.  describes an
extensible protocol architecture that allows anyone to customize an
in-kernel protocol graph, which enables applications achieves better
performance compared to similar applications running on conventional
operating systems.

appeared in the proceedings of the 1996 winter usenix technical
conference

 extensibility,
safety and performance in the spin operating system 

 a design, implementation and performance paper.
 appeared in the proceedings of the fifteenth acm symposium on operating systems principles.


 language support for extensible operating systems
  we've been pretty happy with m3, but we've had to deal with a few shortcomings in
order to use the language in a safe extensible operating system. this paper describes
how we've addressed those shortcomings.


 safe dynamic linking in an extensible operating system
 describes the dynamic linker we use to load code into the kernel.  key point is
the ability to create and manage linkable namespaces that describe interfaces and
collections of interfaces.


 protection is a software issue
 a position paper comparing software and hardware protection mechanisms.
 proceedings of the fifth ieee workshop on hot topics in operating systems.


 region analysis: a parallel elimination method for data flow analysis
 in ieee 1995 transactions on software engineering.

i am a ph.d. student in the computer
science department at the university
of california, riverside.  my resume
will tell you where else i've been and what i've done with my life so far.



my research is aimed at developing an autonomous 
intelligent planning system for near-optimal use of limited
resources, when a priori resource-use information is unreliable
or unknown.  my thesis advisor is dr. jay farrell,
assistant professor of 
electrical engineering.  possible applications of our intelligent
planning system include hybrid / electric vehicles such as those
developed at ce-cert,
within the college of engineering.

i spend my free time listening to music, playing volleyball, 
hiking  
up any of the surrounding mountains, or playing soccer on the
cs intramural soccer team,
(a.k.a. the nondeterministic scoring machine) which i helped organize.

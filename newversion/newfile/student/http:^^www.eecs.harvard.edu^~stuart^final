my latest pictures








in march ohio state insisted that i take a "spring break" from engineering. however, the  gods decided that my break shouldn't resemble spring, and
i decided to do some engineering of my own.

this is my officemate, benjamin, who is in charge of office security.
it's no wonder ben and i have gone between three jobs over the last four
years.

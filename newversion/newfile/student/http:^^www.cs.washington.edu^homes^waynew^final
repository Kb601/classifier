 cs stuff 
i'm currently looking at memory system performance.  in particular, different
memory system organizations are being investigated.  this work is being
done with  jean-loup baer.


i am also looking at interpreters with others (
 dennis, 
 ted, 
 geoff, and
 alec).  right
now, things are a little  rocky.

i'm a ph.d. candidate in the department
of computer science at the 
university of
massachusetts.  my advisors are
jim
kurose
 and
don
towsley .  
i also work closely with 
david
yates .  
i'm a member of the computer 
networks research group.



i received my b.a. in computer science from

the university of wisconsin 
in 1988 and my m.s.  degree in computer science from umass
in 1991.  
when they let me, i try to collaborate with the 

network systems research group 
at the 

university of arizona cs department. 
i'm a member of the acm, ieee, and usenix.




check out all these http 

images that the cs department provides.

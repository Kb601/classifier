mountains teach us so much, without saying a word.





hello. i am 
 bogdan 
 ungureanu's home page. 


this document is under construction and open to comment!
suggestions are strongly invited, so if you think of anything, please  
 email it to  bogdan@cs.nwu.edu





i am a so called 
 ils graduate student 
 , (
 
or a 2nd year cs-phd if you prefer 
 )  in 
  computer science 
  at 
 the institute for the learning sciences
  ,  
 northwestern university .
 for now, you can only see  

a few photos i took during the cool robotics class 
 we had in the 1996 spring quarter (special thanks to pete beim for
scanning & making them available on the web), 
but i hope to put some more images on the web, 
let's say, in the near future, since the term sounds relative enough. 

i come from
 cluj-napoca,

romania

 .

if you have time to check out

more information about my homecountry

 , the web has it all.


if you think that sometimes an image can say more than a thousand
words, you may want to take a look at 

some images from romania. 


as much as about my ..


  education

i graduated in 1990, from 

 the technical university of cluj-napoca
 , where i pursued 5 years of full-time study towards an engineer diploma.


since october 1991 i have worked as assistant professor at the same
university, in the  

 cs department . 
i am a member of the 

 ai research group
 there.
   


in 1994 i visited the us for the first time, as an intern in the 
"summer 1994 internship program for the advancement of software
engineering technology".

james p. ahrens and charles d. hansen,  cost-effective data-parallel load balancing ,  international conference on parallel processing, august 1995.



load balancing algorithms typically improve a program's performance on
unbalanced datasets, but degrade its performance on balanced datasets,
because unnecessary load redistributions occur. this paper presents a
 cost-effective  data-parallel load balancing algorithm which
performs load redistributions only when the possible savings outweigh
the redistribution costs. experiments with a data-parallel polygon
renderer show a performance improvement of up to a factor of 34 on
unbalanced datasets and a performance loss of only 27 percent on
balanced datasets when using this algorithm.

this paper presents the design of a visual database system for data and experiment management. our system was designed as a general scientific database system, but motivated by and intended for use in model-based computer vision. we provide a unified data model, a highly graphical user interface, an advanced query facility and an interactive laboratory notebook. the system aids in scientific experimentation and promote data sharing in the computer vision community.



frank a. ortega, charles d. hansen and james p. ahrens,  fast data parallel polygon rendering ,  supercomputing, november 1993.



this paper describes a data parallel method for polygon rendering on a massively parallel machine. this method, based on a simple shading model, is targeted for applications which require very fast rendering for extremely large sets of polygons. such sets are found in many scientific visualization applications. the renderer can handle arbitrarily complex polygons which need not be meshed. issues involving load balancing are addressed and a data parallel load balancing algorithm is presented. this rendering toolkit enables a scientist to display 3d shaded polygons directly from a parallel machine avoiding the transmission of huge amounts of data to a post-processing rendering system.

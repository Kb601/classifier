pardon the dust! 



so, who am i?

i am currently a student working towards a master of arts degree in the 
computer science department 
of the university of texas.  
my thesis describes a new system for performing syntactic 
extensions in the scheme programming language.

resume if you don't believe me.


a few items of personal interest:


my plan
my resume     
my research interests

the carl household     


my daily dose of things on the world wide web

i am a masters student working in the 
software evolution group
at ucsd on automated techniques to assist the maintenance, understanding,
and restructuring of large software systems.  specifically, i am
investigating the adaptation of an existing object-oriented restructuring 
tool for c programs to a generic tool capable of being retargeted to
restructure ada programs.  more details about my research can be found in my 
thesis proposal.

in my other life, i am a software engineer for 
accel technologies, inc.,
an industry leader in the electronic design automation software
market since 1986.  accel develops and supports 
accel eda,
a powerful suite of electronic design software tools for the windows

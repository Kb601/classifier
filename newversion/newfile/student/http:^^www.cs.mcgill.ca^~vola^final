	about
	me

	the rest of 
	rest of this
	page is
	dedicated to the
	game of
	
		othello
	
	



i first programmed the game of otherllo 
during my undergraduate degree, as a project for an artificial 
intelligence course (c.s. 308-424).  my program was written in 
c and ran on dos.  later, i updated this my game to run on 
windows &copy, this time, my program was written in visual c++.  
after having been introduced to cgi programning, i decided to 
update my game of othello for the third time and to put it on 
the internet.  the game has been up and running since september 1995.

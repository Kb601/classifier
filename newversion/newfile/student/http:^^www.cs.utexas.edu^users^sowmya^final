research

my research is in the area of machine learning in the field of
artifical intelligence. i am interested in the problem of learning
bayesian networks from examples. learning a bayesian network with
hidden variables is a challenge. my approach is to apply 
symbolic and connectionist theory revision techniques to address this
problem.

i am also very interested in designing and creating multimedia
applications. 

here is my resume,  and a list of my 
papers.

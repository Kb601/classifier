children, not the wise, speak of sankhya (theory) and yoga (practice) as distinct; he who is truly established even in one, obtains the fruits of both. 
 
that place which is reached by sankhyas (men of theory) is also reached by the yogins (men of action); for sankhya (theory) and yoga (practice) are all one : he who sees [that this is true], he sees [indeed]. 

- lord krishna in the bhagavad gita, chap. 5, verses 4-5.

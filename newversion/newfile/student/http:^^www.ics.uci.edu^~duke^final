duke p. hong is a graduate student at the university of california,
irvine where he is pursuing his ph.d. in computer science. his
research interests are in the architecture and performance analysis 
of data traffic over atm networks. he has been with the 

network research group  led by 
 prof. tatsuya suda
since 1990. he has published a number of papers on connectionless
servers for atm and atm congestion control.



 education 



  currently pursuing ph.d. in information and computer science at
  the university of california, irvine.  
  thesis work is progressing
  in two stages.  the first stage, design of a connectionless server
  for transmitting connectionless datagrams over the connection oriented
  asynchronous transfer mode (atm) network and performance analysis 
  through simulations and analysis, is nearly complete having resulted
  in a paper currently in submission.  the second stage, an exploration
  of the potential fractal nature of atm traffic is currently in progress.
  completion is expected in 1997.


  m.s. information and computer science, 
  university of california, irvine, june 1993.  
  investigated asynchronous transfer mode networks
  and congestion control techniques.


  b.s. computer engineering, university 
  of california, san diego,
  june 1990.  courses were distributed among the software oriented
  computer science and the hardware oriented electrical engineering
  fields.





 experience 

  
  
  
  

  jul. 1992 - present.
  performance analyst investigating the architecture and performance of
  multimedia systems. 

  feb. 1988 - mar. 1990.  technical intern responsible

work in progress 

the following is a brief synopsis of work in progress.
 

	
	data over atm: 
	packet loss probability in a multiplexer is being investigated
	with several packet level cell discarding schemes.  the discarding
	schemes drop useless cells from a packet that has already
	suffered a cell loss.


	
	atm connectionless service: 
	most of work my in 
	atm connectionless service is being summarized
	into a paper to be submitted at a later date.


	
	atm traffic characteristics and self-similarity: 
	efficient methods to evaluate the performance of 
	self-similar traffic is being investigated.


	i currently do not have any papers in submission, but this one
	is in preparation for one.

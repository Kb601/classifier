i am currently on two-year sabbatical from my ph.d. tenure at our famed computer science department. but i do stay
at the same old(en) place and have the same advisor (now boss) -- professor 
kai li. 

my primary duty involves princeton's
scalable i/o projects, among
which i've been developing this deliverable software for the sio/intel
community -- a user-level checkpointing library, 

libnxckpt, for intel paragon
multi-computer. please click and check it out. my duty also includes
some support work for princeton's other sio projects. in addtion, i do some work for
shrimp projects. last summer, i
wrote the linux device driver for our shrimp hardware and later on helped
several people adding new features to it.

in the fall of 1997, i will come back to become a third-year graduate student.
all that's left is a thesis -- what all of us here sweat for five years for.

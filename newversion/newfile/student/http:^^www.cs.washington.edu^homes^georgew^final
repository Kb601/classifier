my interests are computer graphics and multimedia. my thesis work, done
under the supervision of professor 
david salesin,
deals with applying traditional pen-and-ink illustration techniques to the
automatic rendering of three-dimensional models. a few pen-and-ink images
created with our prototype rendering system can be found 
here.

i'm 
getting my phd 
here at the computer science department
of the university of
washington, in the wonderful city of  seattle
.  is it always raining here?  see for yourself, with this
up-to-date weather
report, or sneak a peek at this  live image from a video camera 
mounted outside.  the camera is pointed at our beautiful  drumheller fountain.  on a clear day, you
can catch a glimpse of 
mt. rainier  in all its glory (but this is probably not a clear
day, so here's a nice color picture).

research interests

my work is in the
field of natural language processing.  
more specifically, i am constructing a dialog parser to analyze
dialog structure as well as phrase structure.  this dialog parser will also
be able to handle disfluencies such as hesistations and repairs which are 
common in mixed-initiative dialogs.
i do much of my work with the 
trains group.
 i have also been helping with a 
dialog annotation 
project since it is related to my work on dialog parsing.

wenyu's home page 

welcome to my homepage.

i am a second-year ph.d. student working for prof. gail kaiser. i spent my first two years at shanghai jiao tong university in the  tr class , then i transferred to university of bridgeport, where i just got my b.s. degree. i am also currently a member of upe (upsilon pi epsilon) in connecticut delta chapter.

here is a  picture i took recently.

 i am taing the continuous algorithms course w4241 this semester, if
you are taking the course, you can visit the
course homepage .

 here is some useful (and hopefully interesting) homepages i have
found on the internet. if you are looking for help on various unix
tools, like latex, emacs, lex/yacc, this may be a place to  go .



 my homepage is still under construction, so any good advice is welcome.

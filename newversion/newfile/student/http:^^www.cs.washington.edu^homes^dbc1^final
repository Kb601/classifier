 current work
in my spare time i am a third year graduate student here at
the uw.
i'm interested in
ai
and planning, but i've gotten into user interfaces and maybe even graphics
as well. i'm currently studying knowledge representation, goal-directed
behavior, mixed-initiative planning, activity recognition, and buzzword
acquisition in the context of human-computer interaction.

some of my recent work has been to prototype useful/intelligent interfaces for bob
doorenbos' shopbot.
rather than try to build our own interface, our plan is to somehow
integrate with the interfaces of various on-line stores by building a
"shopping assistant." one simple assistant we've built is a mac application
that automatically reads and parses shopping baskets in order to determine
what products the user is interested in.

i have also collaborated with sean anderson, li-wei he, dan weld,
david salesin, and michael cohen to develop a simple interactive movie
that demonstrates automatic camera planning.

as an apple intern, i worked with dan russell to mix planning technology
into the mac user experience.

i am also a co-developer/perpetrator of pdb, a graphical debugger for the
ucpop family of planners(i'm not just a programmer...i'm also a client).
the number of people whose lives it has touched grows each and every day.
the manual is
here.


i spent my undergraduate career at the
university of chicago,
carboloading at harold's chicken and assisting in the
animate agent lab.

    your browser does not support frames... 
     
    
      to view my home page you can either  download
       netscape navigator 
      or view it  without frames .  
   

  

  note: if you choose the latter, please keep in mind that my pages were designed to be viewed with netscape
  2.0+...the pretty background colors i have chosen to use on some of my pages don't work with all browsers. 
  if you see an obnoxious chartreuse color on any of my pages, don't blame me...get netscape 2.0+!!

 gary duzan 
 a.k.a. tall pale stranger 


	
		
	
		

 the above are from my student id and driver's license, respectively,
since that's all i had handy at the time. they suffice for a rough
approximation of my appearance.

 i'm often on
	isca bbs,
	so you could look for me there. or send me mail. my main address is
	gary@wheel.tiac.net,
	but you could also send it to
	duzan@ccs.neu.edu.
 i'll be looking for work starting in early '97. if you have a challenging
	position available in object-oriented or systems software
	development, please check out my resume in
	text
	or
	postscript
	format.
 for all sorts of strange insights into my personality, 
	
		finger duzan@ccs.neu.edu.
	(it is a little slow at times, so be patient.)
 my home machine, wheel.tiac.net, runs
	netbsd,
	a free berkeley-derived os, and connects to the net via
	tiac,
	the internet access company, using ppp over a motorola power 28.8
	modem.
 since duzan is such a rare name, its origins have always interested
        me. take a look at the
	
		gedcom database
	of the genealogical data that i've collected. most comes from other
	duzan researchers, most notably doug duzan and mary duzan hawley,
	but i've added what i could, including my own branch of the family.
	the database currently contains 4095 people, 1501 families, and is
	about 530k of ascii text.

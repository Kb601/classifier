i'm a phd candidate at the department of computing science at the
university of
alberta. i came from c&oacute;rdoba
(argentina) in september of 1993 to start my phd program.


my research topic is transparent shared memory in multiprocessor
environments. both distributed and tightly-coupled mimd machines are
considered. the emphasis is placed on compiler technology and
meta-programming issues to transparently support shared memory in
procedural pointer-based programming languages.

of the  parallel
programming systems laboratory. my supervisors are:  jonathan schaeffer and
 ron unrau


i am also working for cns

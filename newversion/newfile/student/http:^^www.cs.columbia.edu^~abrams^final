now... getting back to me and my research which is, presumably, the
reason you clicked your way over here in the first place.

i'm currrently a sixth-year phd student in columbia university's
department of computer science working under prof. peter
allen .  my primary research interest is in the field of sensor
planning in an active robot work-cell.  (click here
to learn more about the project.)

i do some work in computational geometry, (right now) mostly
concerned with the efficient computation of the volumes swept by
moving polyhedra.  this is part of the sensor planning work. 


another research interst is the development of large-scale
distributed, object-oriented systems for, among other things, the
control of large, multi-sensor robot systems with multiple planning
components.  other research interests include numerical optimization
techniques, high-level machine vision, and general 3-d geometric
modeling for machine vision.

i also work for stratasys at their new new york location.
they are a developer and manufacturer of rapid prototyping systems.
the manufacturing &
engineering services group of the manufacturing
technologies department of the alberta research council
has provided a very nice description of  rapid prototyping
if you are interested in learning more about it.  

outside of computer science... i'm a music lover. i  like to
listen to, perform, and compose all types of music from gregorian
chants to modern ``new-age'' synthesized music, although my true
musical passions are jazz, funk, and fusion. i also love dogs.
so i just had to make sure that brandy, my dog,
has his own home page. 

some interesting places to go...

 brandy,my sheltie, has his own web page
with pictures and pointers to other neat dog-related internet sites.

here  for an introduction. 

 


thank you for showing interest in my 
home page. i am a ph.d. student
in the 
computer science department at  
 vanderbilt university .



 
i am interested in artificial intelligence, primarily in the areas
of model-based and constraint-based reasoning. in the past,
i have investigated  
model-based reasoning   techniques and
their application to  
diagnosis  . i developed an interest in the application
of constraint-based reasoning to scheduling and design while
working one summer with dr. markus fromherz at xerox parc. 
presently, i am investigating model-based approaches to
hardware and software design of "smart" systems.  my academic advisor
at school is 
 
dr. gautam biswas . 

i have an m.s. degree in computer science from vanderbilt university,
and a b.e. degree in computer engineering from 
 
victoria jubilee technical
institute , bombay, india.

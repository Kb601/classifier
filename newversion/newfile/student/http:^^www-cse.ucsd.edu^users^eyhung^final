 doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before"

-- edgar allan poe

"there are three kinds of death in this world.  there's heart death, 
 there's brain death, and there's being off the network."

-- guy almes



 computers! 

being a cs student, i naturally have many interests related to computers.
these run the gamut from java programming
and rfc reading
to practicing geekspeak(via the 
jargon file).  and, 
of course, a link for what got me interested in computers in the first
place: games!






"if addiction is judged by how long a dumb animal will sit 
pressing a lever to get a 'fix' of something, to its own detriment, then 
i would conclude that netnews is far more addictive than cocaine."

-- rob stampfli



 news and info: 

i'm an avid devourer of news and information, and maintain an active 
interest in what's happening around the world.  in addition to regular 
news, i am also a usenet addict, reading over 60 newsgroups daily (though
down from a high of 120+, since the signal-to-noise ratio has been 
declining considerably of late).

"had i the heavens' embroidered cloths,
 enwrought with golden and silver light,
 the blue and the dim and the dark cloths
 of night and light and the half-light,
 i would spread the cloths under your feet:
 but i, being poor, have only my dreams;
 i have spread my dreams under your feet;
 tread softly because you tread on my dreams."

-- william butler yeats

"we are the music makers,
 and we are the dreamers of dreams.
 wandering by lone sea breakers,
 and sitting by desolate streams;
 
 world-losers and world-forsakers,
 on whom the pale moon gleams:
 yet we are the movers and shakers
 of the world forever, it seems."

-- arthur o'shaughnessy

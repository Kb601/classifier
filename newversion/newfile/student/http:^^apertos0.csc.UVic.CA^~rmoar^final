 roger moar



biography: i'm a graduate student (m.sc. in computer science) at the university
of victoria. i am part of the  panda 
group, which does operating systems research. my thesis work involves
safety and security in download extensible operating systems. i am also
interested in computer security in general, as it never ceases to amaze
me how many hours of work are entrusted to insecure (and therefore essentially
compromised) machines.

 a little security info: 

 some information on x window system
     security.


 sites of (my) interest: 


  pat's page.
  mother jones.
 my hero:  dan farmer.
-->
 the art of  winston smith.
 vancouver's own  wrong records.
  world wide punk and  the punk page.
 the  schwa corporation: helping the planet.
-->
 holy weasels and stoats! the smalls home page.
 and, well,  operating systems. stack and stacks of the things!

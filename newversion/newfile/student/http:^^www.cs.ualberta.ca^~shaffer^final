 here's a bit about me... 
 
i am a computing science graduate student studying in the area
of wireless telecommunications. i completed my undergrad degree in 
computing science at the university of alberta.


while an undergrad student, i participated in the industrial internship
program (iip), and was employed with bell northern research (bnr) located
in ottawa, ontario. i thoroughly enjoyed working with the members of our 
software development team, and the challenges the work presented.

 academic stuff 

i am currently a phd student in computer science
at the johns hopkins university in baltimore, md.
i am blessed with not one, not two, but three advisers, simon kasif,
eric brill,
and david yarowsky.
while my general interest is in artificial intelligence, the focus of my research is
on adaptive methods for information retrieval.

i've compiled a survey of information retrieval which
lists many different papers, projects, and web sites devoted to various 
aspects of ir. if you're just learning about the field, be sure to check
out my glossary.

i am also extremely interested in teaching.


 personal interests 

i am a huge fan of games and puzzles of any type.
i've made up a page giving some of my favorite
sites and presenting puzzles that i've created. if you're a fan of monopoly,
check out my expansion powers monopoly.
other interests are

 reading
 baseball (especially
the mets, 
pirates, and
orioles)

 movies
tv (especially

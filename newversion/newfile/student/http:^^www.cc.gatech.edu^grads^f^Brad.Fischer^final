    master's degree, computer science,
    georgia institute
of technology

hey dudes!

i'm brad fischer, a master's degree recipient at
the college of computing.
i finally finished my degree in december, 1995!

what's new here


december 16, 1995
i got access to a color scanner, so i added a
photograph page.  my 
r&eacute;sum&eacute; is slightly updated,
reflecting my new degree (and i made general
updates to the whole site to reflect that).


projects on the world wide web

i revised the web site for the

pauline oliveros
foundation. vita brevis, ars longa.

during the summer of 1995 i worked on
citation, a class project for one of
my courses.

in the summer of 1994, i worked on another class project: the design
of an interface
for an information kiosk system for an art museum.

i helped create the management organizational review online
network system, which i use to tell my managers
what i'm
currently doing as well as what my recent
accomplishments are.  the system is so clever, it even knows what
your 
current job responsibilities are! (i ought to mention that this service
is provided by encompass technologies)


art and music
i dabble in photography
 and music.  some of it is worth sharing.
this is how i keep this web site from being totally content-free; none
of this stuff should be available anywhere else.

other stuff
if you're desperate for entertainment, here are some other things you can
read about:

my education
my background
my job
my (strange) sense of humor

if, on the other hand, you want to find out about someone interesting,
you can read about katherine setar
(who couldn't get a web page of her own).

you can view my r&eacute;sum&eacute;
or get a copy in postscript.

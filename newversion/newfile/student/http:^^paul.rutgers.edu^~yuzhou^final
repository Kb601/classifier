welcome to yu zhou's homepage






it
seems this page is always under construction!!!




hello, let me introduce myself. albert
is the nickname i would like to use, since the first name "yu" (you)
is very confusing (not to mention also difficult to pronounce) in a group
environment. i am a graduate student (computer science dept.) at rutgers
university where i also had my undergraduate study (guess i am stuck
in new brunswick campus forever!). by the way, i was born in shanghai, china. stay tuned for more web links to the points of interest about china.

here
are some links i have collected so far ...

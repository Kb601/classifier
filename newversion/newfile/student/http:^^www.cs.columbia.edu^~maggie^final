  cryptography 
 as defined by diffie and hellman in the classical paper "new directions in cryptography", cryptography is the study of "mathematical" systems for solving two security problems: privacy and authentication.  topics in cryptography include:

 private key crypto systems
 public key crypto systems
 digital signatures
 pseudo random number generators
 probabilistic encryption
 secret sharing
 zero knowledge protocol
 number theory

  kerberos authentication service  
 kerberos is an distributed authentication service used in a client-
server environment where a trusted third-party service is used to verify the
identities of users or clients.  the kerberos authentication model is based
in part on the needham and schroeder key distribution protocol with the
addition of timestamps.  it uses the data encryption standard in cipher
block chaining mode.  kerberos was implemented at project athena at mit in
1986.  the latest version of mit kerberos is version 5 beta 7.  specifications can be found in rfc 1510.
in greek mythology, kerberos is the three-headed dog that guarded the entrance to hades.  it is also known as cerberus in roman.  kerberos appeared in dante's inferno.  (lit hum finally pays off!)

 skills 

 building kerberos authentication servers (mit kerberos version 5 beta 7)
designing and building firewalls using the tis firewall toolkit etc.
 building and maintaining world wide web servers (apache, cern, netscape, nt)
 designing artistic and innovative web pages
 building proxy servers using socks5 and socksifying applications like httpd
 building and maintaining internet news server (inn 1.4)
 configuring and debugging internet services such as dns, nfs, nis(yp)
 building anonymous remailer servers (mixmaster 2.0.3)
 performing system and network administration on sunos, solaris, aix, irix

i am learning about nt and bsdi...


 projects 

 top priority: i am currently working on the multi-authority secret-ballot elections project which is led by my advisor moti yung.

implementing dns service records to allow per-domain definition
of services such as www, ftp, telephony and the like.  dynamic dns - implementing directory service in dns for internet telephony.  secure dns.

packet radio: implemented a packet audio receiver (also known as the most expensive am/fm radio available).  this "radio" receives rtp(real time protocol)-over-udp packets from either a multicast or unicast address and plays them back to the audio device. 

i am the webmaster for the the amiens.

i have recently helped to wire t1 connections and set up a full-service nt server in a residential building in the east village (avenue a and third street).  this building is the first residential building in new york city to have direct internet connections.  this project was introduced on cnn a few months ago.
i have just finished writing the multi-screen on-line ordering system for domino's pizza.  i almost had to apply artificial intelligence to deal with their specials!

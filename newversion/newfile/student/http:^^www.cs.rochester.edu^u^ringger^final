  b.s. (1992) mathematics,
    brigham young university.
    provo, utah.

  m.s. (1994) computer science,
    university of rochester.
    rochester, new york. 

  i'm a ph.d. student working on the interface between
    speech recognition and natural language understanding,
    incorporating prosody.  i work with
    prof. james allen and other members of the
    trains research group.  visit our
    speech research page.

  my other research interests include:
    
	 pattern recognition,
	 statistical language learning and processing,
	 human-computer interaction,
	 multimodal interfaces.
    

  most recently, james,
    brad miller,
    george ferguson, and i have been
    working on a conversationally proficient logistical planning
    assistant.  "trains-96".
    the '96 system involves several modes of transportation, cargo, and a
    sophisticated model of cost.  depending on the research perspective,
    we also call the system a "natural dialgoue system" and a
    "mixed-initiative planning assistant"

  in the not too distant future, we hope to put trains here on the web.
    for the time being, a
    
       quicktime movie (10 mb) of a dialogue with trains-95 will
    have to do.
watch this space for a
    web-accessible graphical- and text-interface to the trains-95
    system!

  during recent summers, i have worked with the
    
       natural language processing research group
    at  microsoft research.
    the 
           speech recognition group there is also doing some
    
       interesting work.  likewise for the
    
       user interfaces group.

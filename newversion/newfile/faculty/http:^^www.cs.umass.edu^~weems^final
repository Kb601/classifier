(with honors) and m.a. degrees from oregon state university in 1977 and 1979, respectively, and the ph.d. from the university of massachusetts at amherst in 1984. all degrees are in computer science. since 1984 he has directed the specialized parallel architectures research group at the university of massachusetts, where he is an associate professor. working together with hughes research laboratories, under arpa support, dr. weems' group developed a heterogeneous parallel processor to support real-time, knowledge-based computer vision. a prototype slice of the architecture has been built and a second generation of the design is under construction. dr. weems also lead an effort to develop a darpa-administered vision benchmark for parallel processors. his research interests include associative processing and architectures, parallel architectures to support low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision, benchmarks for vision, heterogeneous parallel architectures, heterogeneous parallel programming languages, architectural issues and hardware support for hard real-time systems, theory of parallel algorithms and architectures, and parallel vision algorithms. he is the author of numerous technical articles, has served on several program committees, chaired a workshop on benchmarks for vision, given invited talks, edited special issues of machine vision and applications and ieee computer, and is also the co-author of three widely used introductory computer science texts.  dr. weems is a member of ieee, acm, and the iapr technical committee on special purpose architectures.chip weemsassociate professordept. of computer scienceuniversity of massachusettsamherst, ma 01003-4610phone:   (413) 545-3163fax:      (413)545-1249additional informationcourses i teachacademic and industrial committees and boardsconference committeesbibliography of articlesmy textbookswhat i do in my spare timesend me e-mailback to computer science department home page.

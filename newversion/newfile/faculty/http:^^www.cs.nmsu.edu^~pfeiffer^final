biography
i earned my bsc. (1979), msc. (1982), and phd.
(1986) degrees at the university of washington.  since
1984, i've been an assistant professor in the
department of computer science at
new mexico state university.

research interests
current 
research interests include
visual languages
and parallel computer architectures.

my current visual programming research centers on ludwig2, a language for
data structure manipulation based on graph grammars.  here's the html version
of the most recent paper, presented at the 1995 ieee symposium on visual
languages.

personal interests
some of my personal interests are hunting and fishing, rebuilding dodge
musclecars, building model rockets, and practicing martial arts.
i hold a shodan in sanzyuryu jiujitsu
i'm fortunate enough to be married to heather, and
to have two children (joel and becca).

linux compaq concerto pen driver

 
there are some slight incompatibilities between linux 1.2.11 and 2.0.0.
rather than try to #ifdef them, i'm just going to leave both my 1.1.2 and my
new 1.1.3 distributions available for a while.  unless somebody needs an
a.out version of the new driver, i'll just put the elf version out.  if
you're running linux 1.2.11 you need the 1.1.2 version; if you're running 2.0.0
you need the 1.1.3 version; if you're running 1.2.12 or 1.2.13 i suspect you
probably need the 1.1.2 version; if you're running something from 1.3 you're
on your own!
 
in order to obtain the distribution, download either the
1.1.2 a.out, the
1.1.2 elf, or the
1.1.3 version,
gunzip it, untar it, and follow the directions in the readme file.

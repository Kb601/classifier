 bruce g. buchanan
(a.k.a. buchanan@cs.pitt.edu)

i am a professor of computer science,
philosophy, and medicine, with the department of computer science at
the university of pittsburgh.
i am also co-director of the keck center
for advanced training in computational biology.


my main
research interests are in machine learning, knowledge-based
systems, medical expert systems, and computational biology.


i am generally interested in
applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence to any
problems
in biology or medicine.
for an extended discussion of how i view ai research, see

b. g. buchanan, "artificial intelligence as an experimental  science."
in j. h. fetzer (ed.) aspects of artificial intelligence,
amsterdam:  d. reidl, 1988.

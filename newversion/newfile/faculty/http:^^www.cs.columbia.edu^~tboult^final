terrance e. boult


this is terry boult's home page. mouse my face for a color photo.



i am now a  visiting scientist  in the department of computer science of columbia university.  i'm an associate
professor in the ee/cs
department of lehigh university. 


my research interests span vision, numeric computing, information-based
complexity, image processing, object oriented software, and light-wave
networks.  to learn more about my research see  tboult's research page 



i am also an ex-columbia-faculty (86-94), an ex-columbia-graduate
student (ms in cs 83-84, ph.d. in cs 84-86) and an ex-columbia-undergraduate
(b.s. applied math 79-83).  as a doctoral student i received an ibm graduate
fellowship.  i was awarded an nsf presidential young investigator (1990) and
have support from nsf (3 other grants), arpa, and industrial funding from
at&t, ibm, texas instruments and siemens.  eight cu doctoral students have
graduated under my direction, two of them (g. wolberg and l. wolff) have
since won nsf nyi's.  in 1990 i received the ncr stakeholder award which is
given from time to time to an outstanding ee or cs faculty member at
columbia.



while i'm not paid by columbia, i still visit a bit because i have students here
including ph.d. students: 

lisa brown
ming chao chiang
sam fenster
tom o'donnell

and few undergraduates and ms students.  

m. "russell" sarder
veronica hidalgo



i maintain research connections to the vision/robotics lab with
	
 prof peter
allen
 prof. john kender and 
 prof. shree nayar


i also have research collaborations with the information-based complexity
group of 

prof. j.f.traub
prof. h. wozniakowski
visiting prof. art werschulz
 s. paskov
and
s. baker

see also cac-net which is  an electronic
conferencing  system for researchers in algorithms and complexity.

i dabble a bit in many things including vision, numeric computing, image
processing, object oriented software, and light-wave networks.  i 
also enjoy baking, board games, boating, cooking, fishing,
guitar,  golf, hiking, poetry, racket sports, scuba diving, skiing/shredding,
swimming, volleyball and water skiing. (when i get the time, of course ;-)
i'm even decent at a few of these, e.g. i
placed first in the 1991-1992 budweiser/nastar all-star ranking for new jersey
skiers in the 30-39 age bracket with a time was just 5\% behind that
posted by the nastar national pace-setter, u.s. olympian matt grosjean.

biographical sketch
    
    i received my phd in 1990 from the university of waterloo and
    at that time joined the faculty at the university of alberta
    where i am now an associate professor.
    i am a participant as a principal investigator in projects on
    intelligent scheduling and on speech understanding under the
    institute of robotics and intelligent systems (iris ii).
    i have served on the program committees of several international
    conferences and workshops.
    in 1992, a paper i wrote was awarded honorable mention in
    the best written paper competition at the national conference of

    intelligence.

my research interests span a number of
areas in programming languages. currently, i am most interested in
developing type inference systems for object-oriented langauges that
are based on sets of subtype constraints.  the home page of the
hopkins objects group contains all of the papers our group has
written in this area.

papers in other areas, including actors,
programming language semantics, constructive type theory, and hardware
verification.

check out my list of  useful web pointers for programming
languages research, and my vision for
future programming languages research.

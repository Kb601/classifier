 univ. of maryland at college park.



research interests:

 distributed shared memory
 dynamic resource management and adaptation
 parallel computer architecture
 intelligent agents



academic degrees:


 ph.d. (1995), computer science,
rice university.

 m.s.. (1986), computer science,
rice university.

 b.s.. (1986), electrical engineering,
rice university.




research projects:

  coherent virtual
machine (cvm): a flexible
architecture for implementing distributed shared memroy protocols. the cvm
project was established with the goal of investigating novel protocols,
multi-threading support, and extensibility. (related work)


 active harmony:
active harmony is a software architecture that supports efficient
distributed execution of computational objects in dynamic environments
through runtime adaptation, automatic application
adaptation, and novel shared-data interfaces.

  treadmarks:
my dissertation research centered on developing memory models that allow
high performance dsm implementations over networks of workstations. this
research resulted in the definition of lazy release consistency, and
the design and implementation of treadmarks.

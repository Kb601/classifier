g. shin

kang g. shin is professor and director of the real-time
computing laboratory (rtcl) in the electrical
engineering and computer science department at the university
of michigan. 

his research interests include real-time fault-tolerant computing, qos-guaranteed
wireline &amp;wireless networking, real-time control and its application
to reconfigurable manufacturing systems, and os &amp; tools for distributed
embedded applications like automobiles and modern buildings. currently
he leads several major projects, including:


harts
: distributed real-time multicomputer system addressing issues ranging
from a low-level hw architectures to real-time os and evaluation tools.

interconnection
networks: interactions among switching, routing and scheduling
at hw level.

qos-guaranteed
networking: development and evaluation of various protocols that
guarantee such qos as end-to-end delays &amp; jitter bounds, error rate,
and bandwidth.

open-architecture
controller: an erc thrust area dealing with the development of real-time
control and monitoring sw with flexibility and reusability.

armada
a real-time middleware architecture for distributed applications

research:

communication and synchronization in parallel and distributed computers including 
communication protocols, synchronization protocols, routing algorithms, fault-tolerant 
interconnection networks, and techniques for creating portable parallel applications.



current projects:

portable and repeatable parallel applications:
the goal of this project is the creation of software 
that will help application developers 
write correct message-passing code.  the software will 
take a trace of the communication 
events in an mpi (message passing interface) application 
and determine if the application 
will always yield the same results given the same inputs.  
the software will use a novel 
type of vector clock in order to detect race conditions.

fault-tolerant communication networks:
this project studies how communication networks can be 
designed to tolerate a small 
number of faults.  there are two main goals: 1) the 
design of networks that can support 
pipeline (1-d) computations efficiently in the presence 
of faults, and 2) the creation of 
techniques that prevent deadlock despite faulty switches or wires.

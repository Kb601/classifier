rick bunt

b.sc. (queen's), 
m.sc., ph.d. (toronto)








i am a faculty member at
the university of saskatchewan,
where i teach and do research in computer systems in the
department of computer science.
i am the department's graduate chair for 1996/97.
more information about our graduate
program is available from the 
department's home page.
please direct all graduate program inquiries to the department's
graduate secretary.

in broad terms, my research relates to computer systems design and 
performance evaluation, with a particular focus on
operating systems, distributed systems, and computer networks.  
details of specific research projects are given below.
i collaborate in these areas with researchers at saskatchewan and elsewhere,
including 
trlabs,
 ibm canada's centre for 
advanced studies in toronto, and 
hewlett-packard.

i am teaching three classes this year:

 fall term:

 
cmpt 215.3  &#160 &#160 &#160
introduction to computer organization and architecture
 
cmpt 815.3 &#160 &#160 &#160
computer systems and performance evaluation

research projects



at the u of s, my research activities are rooted in
 the 
discus research group, a group 
we (derek eager, 
 
carey williamson,
and i) formed to consolidate our common research interests in the
performance of distributed computing environments.
along with

my graduate students,
i am presently engaged in a variety of projects, including:

 
 
system and networking issues in mobile computing


multi-level file caching in client/server environments

 
performance issues in osf dce
(as part of the 
mandas project in collaboration with ibm canada and colleagues
at five other universities)
 

network management in atm networks.



recent papers in these and other areas are available from 
the discus 
ftp server, along with completed theses of recent students.



other university and professional activities

i sit as a council member in the 
college of graduate studies
and research
and am a member of the board of directors of the university of 
saskatchewan faculty club.
i am also active within acm
sigmetrics, the special interest group for performance measurement
and modelling.


other interests

my head may belong to the university of saskatchewan,


but my heart is with
 the saskatchewan 
roughriders (the 1989 grey cup champs and hosts of the hugely successful
1995 grey cup),
 
the toronto blue jays (the 1992 & 1993 world series champs), and
 the boston bruins 
(soon to be stanley cup champs again).
i also play third base for the 1994 & 1995 league and tournament champion 

black velvet bandits
of the university of saskatchewan fastball league.
and, of course, the 
u of s huskies, 
the 1990 vanier cup champions, will get their licks in '96.

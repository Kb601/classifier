alan d. christiansen



assistant professor 

director, graduate studies 
director, robotics and automation program








i'm interested in autonomous systems (agents) for design automation, 
manufacturing, education, and internet-based commerce.  the 
enabling technologies supporting these interests include machine learning,
automated planning, computer graphics, user interface design, and the 
world-wide web.

if you are interested, i have written down some ideas for honors/master's 
projects.
my most recent paper is 
automated design of part feeders using a genetic algorithm.

jamie callan is a research assistant professor.  his research includes
improved methods of representing and retrieving full-text documents,
high speed document filtering algorithms, and algorithms that learn a
person's information needs.  he also works actively with members of
the 
center for intelligent information
retrieval
to define technology
transfer projects involving the
inquery
information retrieval and inroute document filtering systems.

research  areas

programming languages design and implementation
one of the recent results in this area was the design of compiler writing language 
rigal. rigal home page 
 is 
maintained by vadim engelson at university of linkoping, sweden.
testing and debugging automation, assertion languages.
here is a  link to the  
algorithmic and automatic debugging home page. any inputs and suggestions are 
 very welcome.
visual programming languages. 
first draft of the experimental visual programming language v in postscript can be 
downloaded  here. 
software engineering



 seminar on programming environments and tools
is being held on fridays, 1.30 - 2.30 pm, science hall, sh 124.
if you are interested to be on the mailing list, please,
send a message 
      here. 
look for the list of talks  
 presented 
at the seminar.

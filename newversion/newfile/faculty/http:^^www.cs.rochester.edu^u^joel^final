joel i. seiferas, urcs faculty member

b. 1947. ph.d. (1974) massachusetts institute of technology. assistant
professor (74-79), associate professor (79); the pennsylvania state
university. associate professor (79-present), department chair
(81-84); university of rochester.

how can we characterize the structure and complexity of the range of
algorithms that solve a fundamental computational problem? what are
upper and lower bounds on the computational resources (especially time
and space) that are needed, and how do these relate to the
capabilities of the computer model being used? what are the right
architectures to consider, and what are the best techniques for
proving such bounds? these and related questions continue to motivate
joel's interest and research in computer science.

recent research has involved an information-theoretic lower-bound
technique based on descriptional complexity and algorithmically
incompressible data. upper bound work has included algorithms for
string matching and text indexing, and counter-intuitive real-time
simulations of counters and multihead tapes. recent research
supervision and topics courses have involved circuit complexity,
probabilistic automata, on-line load balancing, the geometry of
string-edit distances, cryptography and multi-party computation, and
parallel string matching.

research with current students involves lower and upper bounds on
redistribution cost for on-line density control, and space-efficient
techniques useful in the simulation of probabilistic automata.

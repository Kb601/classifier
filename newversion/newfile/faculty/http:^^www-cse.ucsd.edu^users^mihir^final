 recent research and publications 

i work in the following areas-- 

 
  cryptography: you can find  
papers and a  research summary. 

  complexity theory: (probabilistic proofs and approximation, 
interactive proofs, randomness.)  you can find  papers and surveys and a  research summary.  

  other: (computationl learning theory, distributed computing.) 
you can find  
papers and a  research summary.  

 

i have only listed work from 1992 onwards. if you want an earlier
paper, please contact me. 



 some links 


  crypto links: pointers
to high level link collections, and a few direct links

  pcp and approximation: pointers
to survey articles on probabilistically checkable proofs and their
application to approximation.

current schedule 

areas of research
my main area of interest is programming languages, especially program analysis and compiler optimization.  recently, i have been working on constraint-based program analysis algorithms, including constraint theories, complexity, algorithms, and implementation issues.  a demonstration constraint-based type inference system,  illyria, is available.

 i'm also interesed in so-called "end user programming", or how to
make programming accessible to non-programmers.  toward this end, i'm
involved in developing two special purpose languages: 
tioga, a database visualization system that makes it easy for
people without visualization expertise to turn relational data into pictures,
and  tree, a project to make conversion between data formats
simple without the use of arcane sed, awk, and perl scripts.

biographical sketch
  alex aiken received his bachelors degree in computer science and music from 
   bowling green state university 
  in 1983 and his ph.d. from 
   cornell university
  in 1988.  alex was a research staff member at the  ibm almaden
 research center before joining the berkeley faculty in 1993.  he is
  married to 
  jennifer widom, and they have a young son  tim.  jennifer has  photos from the couple's travels in the pre-baby days.

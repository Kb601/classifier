ed lazowska








ed lazowska is professor and chair of the

department of computer science & engineering
at the

university of washington.


lazowska received his a.b. from 
brown university in 1972, and has been at the university
of washington since receiving his ph.d. from the

university of toronto in 1977.
his research concerns computer systems and computer system
performance.  recent specific topics have included parallel
discrete-event simulation, scheduling policies for multiprocessors,
kernel structures to support high-performance parallel computing,
programming systems for networks of multiprocessors, effective
program performance monitoring tools for parallel systems, the
interaction of architecture and operating system design, hardware
and software techniques for high performance communication, and,
most recently, operating system and programming system support that
exploits wide-address architectures

(opal).  almost all of this work has actually
been carried out by terrific students, and has been supervised
jointly with

hank levy or

john zahorjan; lazowska mostly
wears
ties,
pushes paper, and racks up frequent flier miles.
(the graduate students seem to have picked up on
this (1.7mb
quicktime).)  he
also hosts lots of visitors, a surprising number of whom have
funny
noses.


lazowska is a member of the board of directors of the
 computing research
association (cra's members include essentially all
graduate departments and industrial research laboratories
in the field), and chair of

cra's government affairs committee.
he serves on the national science foundation's advisory
committee for 
computer and information science and
engineering,
and on the national research council's
computer
science and telecommunications board.
he is a member of the 6-person technical advisory board for
microsoft research,
of the 4-person
national
semiconductor computer science &amp; systems academic
advisory council,
of the board of directors of
data i/o corporation,
and of the scientific advisory board for
cable &amp; howse ventures' cascadia fund.
he belongs to the standing advisory committees
for the
department of eecs
at uc berkeley and
the departments of computer science at
stanford university,
the university
of virginia,
and the hong
kong university of science &amp; technology,
and is a member of acm's
a.m.
turing award selection committee.
he has just completed service on a 12-person national research council
panel reviewing the multi-agency

high performance computing
and communications program
(the "brooks/sutherland committee"), and
has recently served as chair of the committee of examiners
for the graduate record examinations board computer science test,
chair of acm sigmetrics (the association for computing machinery's
special interest group concerned with computer system performance),
chair of the acm software systems award committee, program chair
of the 13th acm symposium on operating systems principles, and
editor of ieee transactions on computers.


at the university of washington, in addition to serving
as chair of the
department of computer science & engineering,
lazowska is chair of the university advisory committee on
academic technology.
he has recently served as a member of the
committee on the deanship of the college of arts
and sciences, as chair of the review committee for
the ph.d. program in molecular biotechnology, and as a
member of the performance review committee for the dean
of engineering.  he was selected to deliver the
1996
university of washington annual faculty lecture.


lazowska is
a fellow
of the association
for computing machinery and of the
institute of electrical and
electronics engineers.
seventeen
ph.d.
students and 21 m.s. students
have completed degrees working with him.

i am a  faculty  member
in the 
 department of computer science  at the
 university of saskatchewan .

my area of academic research is ``uncertainty in
artificial intelligence''.   for more than a decade,
i have been interested in the application of probability theory to
problems in artificial intelligence traditionally handled by logics,
grammars and heuristics.  in ai's earliest days, it was widely held
that complexity problems and the unavailability of meaningful
probability distributions made this impractical.  in the last decade,
this opinion has changed.   two major
international conferences, one organized by   the association for uncertainty
in ai and one organized by

the society for artificial intelligence and statistics ,
discuss probabilistic and statistical ai, and
statistical approaches to ai problems have entered the ai
mainstream.  

 



together with colleagues and students, i have looked at
probabilistic approaches to default inference, diagnosis, temporal
reasoning, natural language, and classification. my work appears
in major journals and several
national and international workshops and conferences.  i have also
edited a special issue of

 computational intelligence  journal on the
philosophy of nonmonotonic reasoning, featuring a target article by 

henry e. kyburg, jr. .

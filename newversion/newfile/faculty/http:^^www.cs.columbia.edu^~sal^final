a puzzle to ponder





can you guess what the image means?  (keep browsing for the answer.) 
by the way, the topic of this page is constantly under development until 
that ultimate day......


past research interests and activities:



    learning problem-solving heuristics

my thesis research (1976-1979, see ijcai 1979)

the massively parallel dado machine(~1979-~1989)

hardware

software

patents

current status: 
dado was licensed to a company and abruptly left academia
for its obvious commercialization.  see 
the san francisco examiner
article on page a-1 of the feb. 5, 1996 issue (click on previous
examiners button) for some
information about its current status. the final chapter on dado
has not yet been written! stay tuned!

deductive and expert databases

ace - the first deductive (expert) database system (1980 - ~1982)


active/deductive database
system reorganization and "predictive" load balancing (1990 - ~1994)

the paradiser system (1990-~1994)

parallel rule-based systems (then and now) (1980 - ~1994)

incremental rule processing in parallel environments (1990 - ~1994)

"real-world" application 
studies 
alexsys - mortgage-backed security trading in parallel. (1988 - ~1990)

current interests: parallel/distributed intelligent systems (1990's - )


knowledge discovery in 
database and data mining (kdd/dm)

my former days of expert systems research, and parallel hardware design
and implementation were great fun. 
but now i am specializing in parallel/distributed processing for 
machine
learning
(or 
alternatively click here),
intelligent information systems, 
knowledge discovery in databases and data 
mining, financial systems computing, and active databases.   
check out upcoming events like 
kdd96, or aaai96 (i'm on the pc of
both) and journal sources like 
kluwer's journals in this area. 
i am a member of  the editorial board of the 
journal on 
data mining and knowledge discovery. please take a look at 
our call for papers.

see also the page on the 
parallel and distributed
intelligent systems lab  for a more thorough treatment of my 
current research activities and relationship to industrial users. 



merge-purge: intelligently integrating heterogenous databases

although  the term merge/purge is
used by our citicorp collaborators and other commercial organizations, 
it is probably better termed
the data scrubbing, or data cleaning problem.
(that's a term mike stonebraker used to describe
this problem--and stonebraker-terminology is almost always colorful 
and illuminating.) our most recent success on data supplied by the
child welfare department of the state of washington is memoralized in
the letter viewable by clicking here.


meta-learning for scalable data mining
meta-learning
is a term we coined for an approach gaining in popularity in the dm/kdd
community these days. 
the essential idea is to combine a number of separately learned
classifiers or models in such a fashion that machine learning can be scaled
to large (and inherently distributed) databases, and 
(ideally) accuracy can be boosted. but how does one combine separately 
learned classifiers? we consider that question as a learning problem and apply
machine learning algorithms to "meta-learn" how underlying classifiers
behave or correlate with eachother. hmmmmm...


electronic commerce and
financial information systems: 
widely distributed data mining and fraud detection

my current interest lies in the future of large scale network-based
information systems, especially fraud and
intrusion detection.
we are studying methods to apply learning agents, and meta-learning agents
in wan financial information systems to learn how to detect fraudlent
transactions. this work is directly relevant to information warfare
problems that will undoubtedly occur in the future. (these problems
probably occur today but no one has yet learned how to detect it globally! 
stay tuned!)
  
this research is being conducted in collaboration with our friends
at the financial services technology consortium.,


integrating multiple models: aaai96 workshop

many researchers are working on similar techniques for integrating 
multiple learned models.  so phil chan, david wolpert and myself
are organizing a workshop at aaai-96 called
integrating multiple models
for improving and scaling machine learning.
see the workshop agenda and call for papers. please participate
directly if you are interested in pursuing these ideas or if you have
new results to share with the community.


speeding up monte carlo 
simulations

i've also studied parallelization strategies for monte carlo simulations.
check out dynamic neighborhood bounding, a simple heuristic strategy
to save on expensive function computations that is also amenable to
fast parallel execution. (follow the link to "papers".)


collaborators



financial services technology consortium (fstc)

i've been working with the 
financial services technology consortium 
(fstc) having played some small role in its early formation. 
the fstc's "fraud project" is the focus of our joint effort. 
see the description on 

fraud and intrusion detection in financial information systems using 
meta-learning agents 
for details about our approach.

citicorp

my relationship with citicorp
was established through my consultancies and research relationships
with the citicorp technology office. working with companies like
citicorp is  a wonderful opportunity to learn about
real-world problems and datasets for use in establishing benchmarks and
controlled studies of fundamental technologies. 

my collaboration with citicorp and other organizations 
lead to the development of a number of 
fundamental technologies that were demonstrated in "real-life" financial 
applications.  some of these are described  in this web page. seek them
out.


system management arts

smarts is a spinoff from the research lab of 
professor yechiam yemini.
their sos agent infrastructure is being used in our work on meta-learning
agents for fraud and intrusion detection.

contact points and my phd students

i'm always looking for good people to work with me.  how would you like 
to help me build an agent-based learning
system  operating over the internet for detecting fraud in electronic 
commerce? send a note of interest and we might talk about it...

send email to sal@cs.columbia.edu.

you can find out much more about these topics by contacting me
directly or my phd students, former and current.
(maybe that includes you sometime in the future?)


the answer

did you guess what the image means?   


my greatest achievement in life

one last thought (for now). of all my accomplishments, 
absolutely none come close to 
my true achievement in life.


fun at my home town
and i especially enjoy doing all sorts of things for my community
mostly through my kids' schools. some of you may even have heard 
of a special event in ridgewood, new jersey where we live. its called


dads night.


ridgewood has all sorts of interesting events going on. another one that
i am happy to be involved with is 


super science saturday. 


visit the homepages of both for a peek at what's up in ridgewood!


and if you haven't figured out what i might look like 
well check this out too.

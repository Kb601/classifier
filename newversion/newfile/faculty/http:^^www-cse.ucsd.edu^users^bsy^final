bennet yee's research focuses on issues in
computer security.  there are many inter-related areas that impact the
security of systems: user-interfaces, software systems design, theorem
proving, and cryptography all play important roles.



one particular area that bennet has been working on is the secure
coprocessor model, where physically secure
(tamper-detecting/-proof) hardware is added to conventional computing
systems.  we perform security-critical operations such as the
execution of cryptographic protocols and access control decisions only
within secure coprocessors, where both privacy of key material and
integrity of security databases are axiomatic -- thereby bootstrapping
security properties from the secure coprocessor to the entire system
as a whole.  this work includes some (minimal) hardware design,
operating system implementation (porting
mach
3.0 microkernel to the prototype hardware), and cryptographic protocol
design.  much of this work was done jointly with
doug tygar at
carnegie mellon and
ibm's
embedded
cryptographic systems group.



more recently, bennet has been examining the design of practical
cryptographic protocols for efficient and yet secure internet-based
transactions, secure-coprocessor-based applications, and electronic
commerce.  he was one of the coauthors of the
pct protocol from
microsoft, and more recently he's
been working with netscape,
microsoft, and others within the
framework of the
internet
engineering task force to come up with a merged protocol
satisfactory to all parties.



bennet maintains a list of web resources relating to
computer security, ranging from cryptography resources, system
security testing tools, to word compilations useful in eliminating
easy-to-guess passwords.  in addition to looking at the world wide web
from the security and internet commerce point of view, bennet also
indulges plain old fun hacks and web-based link
collecting.  (see also his web links page).



his web pages here are still being worked on.  you may be interested
in bsy's web pages at cmu.



some of bennet's papers are online.  his
pgp public key is available.



bennet is teaching
cse 30 and
cse 291 this quarter.



bennet taught cse 80 in spring 1996; the archived web pages from the
course is still available.

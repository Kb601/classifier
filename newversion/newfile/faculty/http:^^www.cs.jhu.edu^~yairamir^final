education 


1995  ph.d.  the hebrew university  computer science 
1990  m.sc.  the technion           computer science
1985  b.sc.  the technion           information systems engineering



research interests


distributed systems, communication protocols, conferencing, and
replication.
currently, i am building the distributed systems and communication
lab at the department of computer science here at hopkins, and
also am affiliated with the center of excellence in space data
and information sciences (cesdis),
the goddard space flight center, nasa.


the main project in the distributed systems and communication
lab is commedia, a cross-platform 
infrastrcuture for multimedia conferencing. commedia will combine a 
reliable multicast toolkit
(spread) with video, voice, graphics, and application sharing
over local and wide area networks. the development is done over
bsdi unix and win95. we are just strating, so it is not too late
to join!


since i received my b.sc., i gained vast experience in building
distributed systems. i spent six years building such a defense
system, heading a 50 man-years effort and delivering an operational
solution to the customer.
subsequently, i spent four years researching and building (i.e.
playing with) distributed systems, network protocols and replicated
databases. and guess what: i even got a phd for that :)
i was one of the initiators and main participants of the transis
project with professor danny dolev
at the hebrew university of jerusalem, israel. transis is a group
communication tool that supports reliable multicast services over
a partitioned network. transis utilizes the hardware unreliable
multicast where possible, optimizing the performance for existing
networks.
i also took part in building the totem
group communication protocol with professors melliar-smith
and moser
at the university of california, santa barbara.
other people i enjoy collaborating with, are david breitgand,
gregory chockler,
nabil huleihel,
and avishai wool.

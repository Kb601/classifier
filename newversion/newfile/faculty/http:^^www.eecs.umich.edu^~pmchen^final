i am directing the rio (ram i/o) project at the university of michigan.
rio is investigating how to use non-volatile memory (flash or battery-backed
dram) to store files, and to do so reliably and inexpensively.

    university of michigan cse-tr-286-96, march 1996.
    this is a earlier tech report version of the asplos paper.  the major
    difference is that the asplos version uses the new protection scheme
    that forces all addresses through the tlb, whereas the tech report
    version uses code-patching and consequently gets worse performance.

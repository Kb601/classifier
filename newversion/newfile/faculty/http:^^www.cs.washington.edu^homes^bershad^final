 brian bershad , assistant professor, has been at the university of
washington since 1986.  after receiving his phd from the university of
washington in 1990, he took a brief respite from seattle between 1990
and 1993 to experiment with post-industrial culture in the northeast.
in 1993, he returned to the northwest for the coffee.

bershad does research in operating systems, distributed systems,
networking, parallel systems, and architecture.  a lot of his work has
appeared in tocs, sosp, asplos and isca, although he can't seem to get a
sigmetrics paper published to save his life.  

besides working, bershad runs, plays squash, and hangs out on the
stairmaster.

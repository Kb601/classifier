 read about limitations of freedom of speech on the internet
www page. and what you 
can do about it.  

the us congress
has passed sweeping legislation that will restrict speech on online
networks throughout the country. what you see, read, and write in
public will be curtailed because of this legislation.


    some quotes taken from the student net at wesleyan...

  

       "more computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single
       reason - including blind stupidity."

 w.a. wulf 
  

       "we should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil."
  

      donald knuth

       
  "the best is the enemy of the good."

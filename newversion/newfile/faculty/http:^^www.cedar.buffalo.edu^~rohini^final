state university of new york at buffalo



rohini srihari is a research scientist at cedar.
she is concurrently a research assistant professor in
the 
department of computer science
, 
state university of new york
at buffalo.

her research centers on the use of linguistic
information in the interpretation of spatial (visual) data.
this research spans several sub-disciplines within ai including
computer vision, natural language understanding, spatial reasoning
and knowledge representation.

she heads three research efforts: 

language models for recognizing handwritten text

,

use of collateral text in understanding photos in documents

, and

show&tell: a multimedia system for
automatic image annotation and content-based retrieval

.


she is the chair of a

aaai symposium on computational methods
for integrating language and vision

to be held at mit in november '95.


rohini srihari received a b. math. in computer science
from the university of waterloo, canada.
she received a ph.d. in computer science
from suny at buffalo in 1992.
her dissertation addressed the use of collateral text
in interpreting photographs.

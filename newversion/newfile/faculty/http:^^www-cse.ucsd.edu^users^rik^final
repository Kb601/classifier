i am an associate professor of computer science, with special research
interests in  machine
learning and free-text information retrieval.  virtually all of
this work has been done with students, as part of a research group we
call the cognitive computer science research
group.  i've tried to give an overview of the research we've done
in the sections  below.  if you
are looking for a particular paper, you can proceed directly to the 
references
section, where a number of them can be found online.

saumya received a b.tech. (hons.) degree in electronics and 
electrical communications engineering, from the indian institute
of technology, kharagpur, in 1981; and m.s. and ph.d. degrees
in computer science, from the state university of new york at
stony brook, in 1983 and 1986 respectively.  he has been at the
department of computer science at the university of arizona since
1986, where he is currently an associate professor.
he has been involved in the development of
a number of implementations of logic programming systems, including sb-prolog
and janus, as well as the caslog cost analysis system for prolog.
more recently, he has been working on the alto link-time
optimizer.
 
saumya is an associate editor of the 

acm transactions on programming languages and systems (toplas)
and an area editor for the 
 technical notes area of 
journal of logic programming .
he was program co-chair for the 1990 north american conference on logic 
programming, and has served on program committees for the popl, pldi, 
and ilps conferences.

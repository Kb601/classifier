prof. schwan has been working with experimental and commercial 
parallel machines since their inception in the late 70's. his research
is driven by relevant applications developed as part of a multidisciplinary
laboratory at georgia tech -- the hppcel laboratory contains uniprocessor
and multiprocessor supercomputers (a cray machine, an ibm sp-2, and
networked sets of workstations like ibm rs6000, sun and sgi machines). his
research is also driven by the future heterogeneous smp and distributed
systems infrastructure experienced in commercial and research settings --
the distributed laboratories project is constructing a heterogeneous
computing environment consisting of atm-networked uniprocessor and smp machines,
jointly offering the computational power and interconnection bandwidth of
modern supercomputers.



applications and the  hppcel laboratory.

the hppcel laboratory for experimentation with parallel applications
is undertaking the development of several sample, large-scale parallel 
applications jointly with end users (

molecular dynamics, 


atmospheric modeling,

finite element codes, fluid flow applications). in
each case, these `applications' not only
consist of specific computational tasks, but also include online analyses 
being performed for these computations and real-time visualizations of program 
data and monitoring of performance information, all of which are executed 
simultaneously such that end users can inspect program results and steer
program executions to gain experimental insights. additional applications
used to evaluate operating system support, program adaptation, and
programming environments research have included:
(a) robotics applications and real-time simulations (the asv autonomous
suspension vehicle, schema based robot navigation, and discrete
event simulations), (b) real-time multi-media applications involving
multiple machines and human end users, (c) the design and 
implementation of interactive graphical interfaces for high performance
applications, and (d) graph-based searching algorithms used in the solution of
operations research problems.





distributed laboratories.

 
the topic of our joint research is the realization of 
distributed laboratories, where individuals can interact with each other,
and more importantly, with powerful, distributed computational tools as
readily as if all were located in a single site. our intent is to permit
scientists, engineers, and managers at geographically distinct locations
(including individuals ``tele-commuting'' from home) to combine their
expertise in solving shared problems, by allowing them to
simultaneously view, interact with, and steer sophisticated
computations executing on high performance distributed computing platforms.
prof. schwan's primary contribution to this effort concerns the construction of
a distributed laboratory for experimentation with high performance
numeric computations for applications in molecular physics,
atmospheric sciences, working with high performance atmospheric and 
pollution modelling, and manufacturing systems. in addition, prof. schwan's
group is involved in the development of basic technologies facilitating the
use of future heterogeneous and large-scale distributed and parallel systems.
these technologies are concerned with ``middleware'' software
that will be directly utilized by distributed laboratory applications and
described in more detail below:


the falcon project is studying the dynamic monitoring, adaptation, and 
interactive steering of high performance computations for on-line control of 
``virtual laboratory instruments'' and for ``what-if?'' experimentation with 
complex simulation models by distributed laboratory users. 

 the cobs project is concerned with the distributed systems and
communication technologies underlying distributed laboratory applications. 
the emphasis in distributed systems research is on support for shared-state
in multi-granular and distributed computing environments.
research in communication protocols is concerned with providing the necessary
communication latencies, bandwidths, and transmission guarantees across 
heterogeneous underlying communication media.




prof. schwan's current research addresses three basic research topics
addressing the computational requirements and underlying hardware systems 
presented by the hppcel and distributed laboratory efforts: 

 programming support tools, 
 operating systems, and
 communication protocols.




programming tools - falcon. 
the  falcon 
project addresses the construction of interactive parallel programs, 
even permitting programmers to `steer'
such applications. steering may be defined as:

 
 program steering - 
a program that can interact with human users during its execution,
where the purpose of such interactions is the use of on-line program
information to affect or `steer' program execution.


the falcon project's goal is to have high performance programs become 
equally interactive as commonly used pc tools (e.g., spreadsheets) such that
program performance is either maintained or improved! the expectation is
that scientists can work more effectively when able to view program results
during execution and steer program execution toward useful data domains. the
initial experience is that on-line steering can improve the performance of
programs by avoiding needless execution and by adapting (algorithmically)
specific program abstractions to better match their functionality to 
dynamically varying program characteristics. in essence,
we expect to gain significant increases in the usefulness of parallel
programs to end users and in program performance by use of steering.



falcon offers specific support for program performance
monitoring, evaluation, and tuning, and they provide system integration
support using an incore data dictionary. using falcon, information required for 
performance tuning is easily captured, analyzed, displayed, and then 
used for program performance improvement. program monitoring is 
performed in an identical fashion for both shared and non-shared memory 
parallel machines, using language-based and graphical user 
interfaces. using programming extensions of falcon now under development, 
program tuning is performed graphically, as well, by explicit manipulation 
of parallel programs displayed as hierarchical sets of related objects. 
the tools will be used in the context of large-scale parallel applications being
interactively steered by end users. the falcon tool is
operational on suns, sgis, ibm rs/6000, ibm sp-2 and the ksr
machine. falcon's programming extensions are still under construction, but 
their runtime support is already operational.



adaptable operating systems.
the efficient execution of a parallel program
requires that operating system primitives match the program's performance
and reliability requirements. by constructing and evaluating novel
operating system mechanisms for multiple parallel architectures,
we are studying high-performance operating system support for multiple
parallel applications, including real-time applications, scientific and 
engineering codes, discrete event simulations, and optimization codes.



this research has resulted in several software libraries that facilitate
the construction of parallel programs. the 

`cthreads' 

library is commonly used in operating systems and parallel computing courses 
and is available on many uniprocessor and multiprocessor machines. 
its extensions toward `configurable cthreads' address the on-line
monitoring and configuration of high performance parallel programs, ranging 
from the rapid adaptation of individual program abstractions to 
user-directed program steering. 

specific examples of configurable abstractions constructed with the 
cthreads basis include (1) 

adaptable multiprocessor locks

able to improve program performance by adapting lock characteristics to 
program behavior during program execution and (2) 

adaptable communication protocols




the dsa (distributed shared abstractions) library for construction of 
distributed objects is available on shared and (in a prototype version) on 
distributed memory machines, including networks of workstations. 



its purpose is to support programmers in the construction of efficient 
program abstractions capable of spanning both shared memory and distributed 
memory platforms. its initial smp prototype is now being extended to address
both sets of platforms, including larger scale distributed systems (see the
cobs project described below).



the 

kernel toolkit (ktk) 
is a substrate for parallel programming 
and for the development of multiprocessor operating system kernels. at the
object-level, it gives developers the ability to construct custom 
implementations of object-based operating system abstractions. objects are
customized using meta-object-like interfaces described by `object attributes'
and implemented by `policies'. since policies may be present at runtime,
ktk objects may also be dynamically adapted to suit varying runtime requirements
of parallel and distributed applications. ktk`s attributes are the principal
basis for construction of adaptable objects in the cobs project described
next.



the 

cobs 

project's purpose
is the development of technologies for high performance implementations of
objects across smp and networked platforms. its initial prototype provides
both dsm and dsa support on networked systems, and it offers developers
basic mechanisms for programming diverse object abstractions, ranging from 
shared blocks of memory of varied consistency to typed objects offering 
well-defined operational interfaces, with varying methods for invoking both. 
the intent of cobs is to interoperate with com objects while also permitting
developers to implement object functionalities for both interactive network
applications and high performance distributed programs. cobs is our group's
vehicle for experimentation with operating system constructs for the 
heterogeneous parallel machines now commonly used in advanced industrial and 
laboratory settings.



real-time systems.
for real-time systems, the chaos-arc operating systems and a real-time
version of cthreads jointly implement reliable parallel computations for
multi-target parallel machines and for real-time applications.



chaos-arc demonstrates new operating system constructs that are required 
when programmers need to enforce and guarantee 
timing constraints of multiple and parallel components of real-time 
programs, in the presence of uncertain external execution environments.
chaos-arc's prime contribution is the `atomic real-time computation', 
which is an operating system construct that allows programmers to enforce
or recover from a timing constraint formulated for a set of invocations
of objects. the system was used with parallel, real-time programs
on a bbn butterfly multiprocessor and is now being used on a kendall square 
supercomputer. besides its operating system kernel
(running on top of the cthreads package), chaos-arc consists of a 
programming language for the description of objects (an
extension of c) and other program development tools. chaos-arc has also been
ported to sun sparcstations, to sgi machines, and to the kendall square
supercomputer.
for the lowest level of chaos-arc, we have designed a real-time threads package 



that performs thread scheduling such that deadline guarantees are made
for static and dynamic thread arrivals. the real-time threads package 
has been implemented on the bbn butterfly, at user level and on bare
hardware, and it is now being implemented on the ksr supercomputer
and on sun sparcstations.

our current research in real-time systems concerns the on-line scheduling of
real-time threads
using classical formulations of timing constraints, as well as the development
of technology for real-time simulation.

program-program communications and human interactive services. for such systems,
a benchmark application being developed by our group is able to emulate the
behavior of video delivery systems and of more dynamic systems like those

dr. sitharam received a b. tech. from the indian institute of
technology, madras, india, in 1984 and a ph.d. in computer science in
1990 from the university of wisconsin, madison, in 1990.  she joined
the faculty of the department of mathematics and computer science at
kent state university in 1990, and served as a humboldt fellow
at the university of bonn in 1990-1991.  




research interests

complexity in any guise: 
computational (boolean and algebraic), 
learning, 
descriptive  (using logic
and finite structures), kolmogorov (information theoretic), 
communication; 

approximation theory, splines, and related algorithms;

discrete algorithms-theory and implementation;

discrete and algorithmic modelling of real-world situations.

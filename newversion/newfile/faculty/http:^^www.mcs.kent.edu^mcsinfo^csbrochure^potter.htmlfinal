professor



jerry potter received his bachelors degree from the university 
of iowa, his masters from stevens institute and his ph.d from the 
university of wisconsin, madison.
he has worked at ida's supercomputing research center, 
goodyear aerospace, xerox research and bell telephone laboratories. 
he is a professor of computer science at kent state university.
while at goodyear, he was involved in software development for
the staran, aspro and mpp simd computers.
while at the supercomputing research center, he performed research on
the connection machine for 1 and  1/2 years. 
he has been funded by the naval ocean systems center (nosc), the office of 
naval research (onr), the naval surface weapon center (nswc), nasa langley,
nasa lewis and an ohio edison innovative research grant.
his research interests include the continuing
development of the associative computing paradigm, the integration
of associative simd computers with other architectures in a heterogeneous
supercomputer environment, the development of techniques for compilation on
massively parallel simd computers, natural language 
and artificial intelligence processing on simd computers, and the 
development of techniques for the introduction of parallel programming
at the high school level.



selected research accomplishments
  

over the last 5 years, dr.  potter has developed and implemented the
``associative computing paradigm&quot; as a general purpose approach to
parallel computing.  his research has resulted in an associative
language (asc) incorporating constructs to exploit associative search
and memory allocation for scalable parallel computing.  he has
recently published a ``frontiers of computer science&quot; research
monograph ``associative computing'' (plenum publishers, february 1992)
on his work in associative computing.  he was awarded an ``ohio
innovator award&quot; in 1987 for his research on parallel ops5 and
associative computing.  he has supervised 2 ph. d.  students, 24 ms
students, and refereed for numerous conferences and journals.  he is
also an area editor for the journal of parallel and distributed
computing.  he has had support from nosc and nasa for the
investigation of heterogeneous associative computing.

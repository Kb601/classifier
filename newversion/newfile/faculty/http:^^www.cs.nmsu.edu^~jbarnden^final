teaching

i am currently (fall 1996)  teaching the following courses:


 cs 475: artificial intelligence 1
 cs 575: artificial intelligence 2




research

my research is within artificial intelligence and has the following main aspects:


  representing and reasoning about mental states of agents 
  understanding metaphorical descriptions of
                                    mental states in natural language discourse  
  connectionist approaches to knowledge representation and reasoning.


the work on aspects 1 and 2 mainly uses symbolic ai techniques. 

the work on aspect 3 is largely a separate line of research, though its main
focus is on bridging the gap between connectionism and symbolic ai.

i have done  some work  on the
question of applying connectionism to the task of representing and reasoning
about mental states (= aspect 1).



 selected publications 


  mental states 
(no metaphorical or connectionist angle)
  mental states and metaphor 
  connectionism  
(except as related to mental states, analogy or metaphor)
  connectionism and analogy-based reasoning (related to metaphor)
  connectionism and mental states.













that's it for now.

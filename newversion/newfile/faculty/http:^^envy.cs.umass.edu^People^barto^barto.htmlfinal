my research interests center on machine and biological learning. i have been
trying to develop learning algorithms that are useful for engineering
applications while also making contact with learning as studied by experimental
psychologists and neuroscientists. i am interested in artificial and real
neural networks, and over the last several years i have focused on connections
between reinforcement learning algorithms and dynamic programming solutions to
markov decision problems. related research is being conducted in collaboration
with colleagues specializing in animal motor control. we are working on a model
of the cerebellum and other brain regions involved in motor control.

research areas
my current research interests are: object-oriented programming languages,
object-oriented design, objectbases, multimedia and distributed computing.
the latter three interests are reflected in three collaborative research
projects: tigukat
objectbase management system, multimedia
data management and enterprise
parallel programming system.

tigukat is an objectbase management system with a novel object model whose
identifying characteristics include a purely behavioral semantics and a
uniform approach to objects. everything in the system is a first class object
with well defined behavior. the computational model is one of applying behaviors
to objects.

the multimedia project addresses the issue of providing data management
support for multimedia applications. the general approach incorporates an
object-oriented type system and distributed objectbase functionality.

enterprise is a programming environment for designing, coding, debugging,
testing, monitoring, profiling and executing programs in a distributed hardware
environment. enterprise code looks like familiar sequential code since the
parallelism is expressed graphically and is independent of the code. the
system automatically inserts the code necessary to correctly handle communication
and synchronization, allowing the rapid construction of distributed programs.
this helps bridge the complexity gap between distributed and sequential
software.

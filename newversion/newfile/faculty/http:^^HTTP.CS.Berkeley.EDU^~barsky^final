  biographical sketch



brian a. barsky is professor of
computer science
and affiliate professor of
optometry
and
vision science
at the
university of california
at
berkeley.
he is a member of the

bioengineering graduate group, an
interdisciplinary and inter-campus program, between
uc berkeley
and
uc san francisco.



he was a visiting professor of computer science in the 

modélisation géométrique et infographie interactive group
at 

l'institut de recherche en informatique de nantes
and

l'ecole centrale de nantes,
a visiting professor of computer science at
the
university of toronto,
an attach&eacute; de recherche invit&eacute;
at the
laboratoire image
of

l'ecole nationale sup&eacute;rieure des t&eacute;l&eacute;communications

in paris, and a visiting researcher with the
computer aided design and manufacturing group
at the
sentralinsitutt for industriell forskning
(central institute for industrial research)
in oslo.



he attended
mcgill university
where he received a
d.c.s. in engineering
and a b.sc. in
mathematics and computer science.
he studied computer graphics and computer science at

cornell university
where he earned an m.s. degree.
his ph.d. degree is in computer science from

the university of utah.



he is a co-author of the book an introduction to splines for use in
computer graphics and geometric modeling, co-editor of making
them move: mechanics, control, and animation of articulated
figures, and author of the book computer graphics and geometric
modeling using beta-splines.  he has published 100 technical
articles in this field and has been a speaker at many international
meetings.



dr. barsky was a recipient of an ibm faculty development award and a national
science foundation presidential young investigator award.  he is an
area editor for the journal

cvgip: graphical models and image processing
and the editor of the computer graphics and geometric modeling series of

morgan kaufmann publishers, inc.
he was the technical program committee chair for the
association for computing machinery / 
siggraph '85 conference.



his research interests include computer aided geometric design and
modeling, interactive three-dimensional computer graphics,
visualization in scientific computing, computer aided cornea modeling
and visualization.



he has been working in spline curve/surface representation and their
applications in computer graphics and geometric modeling
for many years.  he is applying his knowledge of curve/surface
representations as well as his computer graphics experience to
improving videokeratography and corneal topographic mapping,
forming a mathematical model of the
cornea, providing computer visualization of patients' corneas to
clinicians,
and developing new techniques for contact lens design and fabrication.
this research forms the
optical (optics and topography involving cornea and lens) project.

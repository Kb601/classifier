 	my interest centers on concurrent and distributed
	algorithms, database systems, and transaction processing.

	processing group
 




traditional algorithms for controlling concurrent access to shared data,
by requiring serializable execution, may unduly restrict concurrency, and hence
performance, in situations where data is accessed heavily or distributed or
where transactions run for long periods of time.  we have explored a variety
of techniques for dealing with these problems, including the use of optimistic
algorithms, multi-version data, and replication.

recently we developed algorithms for improving concurrency by
allowing limited violations of database integrity constraints.
synchronization can be relaxed if integrity constraints are not
strictly enforced.  by controlling synchronization, perhaps in a
state-dependent way, the extent of the violation can be controlled.
violations can be corrected through appropriate compensation.

we are currently investigating the extent to which the semantics of 
transactions (expressed as proofs in a formal system) can be exploited to
improve performance.  we use semantics in several ways: to define a new
correctness criterion for concurrent (non-serializable)
transaction execution, to decompose
transactions into smaller units so that locks can be released early, and
to design a new concurrency control that guarantees correct execution
when these units are interleaved.  we are taking two approaches to transaction
decomposition.  in the first we decompose a transaction into a sequence of
steps.  steps are atomic and isolated and release all conventional locks
when they complete.  a new concurrency control and lock mode is required to 
implement this approach.  the second approach guarantees correctness using
only conventional locks, but in a non-two-phase fashion.  the algorithms 
are being implemented and a test bed constructed to evaluate the ideas.

we are also interested in the use of transaction semantics to better 
understand problems associated with federated databases and compensation.

a brief bio
and photo. 

current research

   the 
internet softbot  enables a human user to state  what  he
or she wants accomplished. the softbot disambiguates the request and
dynamically determines  how  and  where  to satisfy it.

the softbot was one of the  5
finalists  in the 1995  discover
awards for technological innovation in computer software.








 the 
metacrawler softbot is a fielded web service that enables you to search
multiple web indices in parallel, and provides sophisticated pruning
options.  try it!


c|net
recommends the metacrawler as the search service of choice!





 the 
ahoy softbot is a white page service for the web that locates
individual's home pages with high accuracy.   try it!



  brute
force learning:  brute can analyze 100,000 hypotheses a second, when
run on a sparc-10.

new!  check out the computational geometry impact task force's report, 

"application challenges to computational geometry", also as
 postscript and
 compressed postscript, and
 dvi
(or, anon ftp to graphics.lcs.mit.edu, then cd pub, get taskforce.ps.z).

 from 1993-94, i was a postdoc in computer graphics and
computational geometry at princeton, working with pat hanrahan,
michael cohen, david dobkin, and bernard chazelle.  the year before
that, i postdoc'ed at the hebrew university givat ram campus in
jerusalem.  from 1987-92, i was at uc berkeley, completing a
dissertation with  carlo sequin.

 my research interests include global illumination algorithms;
visibility computations; constrained spatial subdivisions; visual
simulation; interactive algorithm visualization, verification and
animation; self-checking geometric algorithms; real-time ray-traced
imagery; and machine vision, including fully automated acquisition
of geometric models and other forms of data.

 i head the 
 synthetic
imagery group, which is part of the
 mit computer graphics group.
our main research emphases are 
1)  digitizing whole cities with pose-instrumented
(6-dof) digital cameras; 2) managing and rendering      
extremely complex geometric datasets; 3) generating 
real-time ray-traced imagery on general-purpose (i.e., non-graphics) 
hardware; and 4) techniques for remote, interactive, collaborative
 undergraduate education.

also,  julie dorsey has
recently joined the 
dept. of architecture and 
 lab for computer science
at mit, and is building the 

visual simulation group.

 this semester (fall 1996), i'm teaching  6.837 (introduction to
computer graphics), which will meet tr from 230-4pm in mit
building/room 
3-270.


spring 1996, i taught  6.046 (introduction
to algorithms), which met tr from 230-4pm in mit building/room
 2-190.

 fall 1995, i taught  6.837
(introduction to computer graphics), formerly  6.037 (it was renumbered to reflect the
fact that graduate students can now take it for "g" credit).  the
course met mwf from 1-2pm in mit building/room 

e25-111.


when the ground isn't completely frozen (and, starting winter 1996, even when 
it is), i play  ultimate  
 frisbee.


i also like to bowl; my lifetime high score is  251.


finally, i enjoy  shrinking my friends (like rob myers) -- no computers were used to make this picture!


here to see some

recent publications (with color figures!), including ph.d. thesis 
and siggraph papers (please let me know if these are not previewable
or printable at your site);



here for some 
 useful computational geometry and graphics 
codes;


here for some large and/or interesting
 geometric datasets, 
including the berkeley soda hall model.

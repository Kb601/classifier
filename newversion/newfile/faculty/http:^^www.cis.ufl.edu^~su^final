  recent research projects 


 osam*.kbms project 
this project deals with the design and implementation of an active
object-oriented knowledge base management called osam*.kbms for use in advanced
applications. 

 parallel architectures and algorithms for
object-oriented knowledge base management
this project aims to study the parallel architectures and algorithms for
efficient processing of large object-oriented knowledge bases. 

 kbms-based evolutionary prototyping of software 
systems
the objective of this project is to develop a high-level prototyping language and a
computing environment for supporting software system development. 

orecom project
the objective of this project is to develop a system to perform
semantics-preserving schema translations in a multimodel, heterogeneous database
envirionment. 

national industrial information infrastructure
protocols (niiip) project
the university of florida's portion of the national industrial information
infrastructure protocols (niiip) project deals with the development of an
object-oriented knowledge base management technology, mediation technology,
extensible object model, knowledge base programming language, and object query
language for supporting interoperability of heterogeneous systems.

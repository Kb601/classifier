  explaining type errors in polymorphic languages
  solving diagramless crossword puzzles
  the calculation of easter
  type reconstruction for coercion polymorphism (sac)

stansifer, ryan.  the study of
programming languages.  englewood cliffs, new jersey: prentice hall, 1995.




i keep a collection of information
about programming languages.
reid's first language survey

-->

miscellaneous


in fact, i do not think that the search for high-level programming languages
that are more and more satisfactory from a logical point of view can stop
short of anything but a language in which
(constructive) mathematics can be adequately expressed.

if you use the web browser "chimera" you may be
interested in the origin of the imaginary being
called the chimera
as explained by jorge luis borges.



the novel the name of the rose by umberto eco ends with the phrase:
"stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus."
eco explains this himself
in a postscript.



my favorite city is

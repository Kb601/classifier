richard enbody



i am an associate professor and associate chairperson of the  department of computer science at 
michigan state
university. my main research interest is in parallel processing,
especially the application of parallel processing to computational
science problems.  information on a collaboration with physics
on buckyballs can be found 
 here.
information on collaborative work on genetic algorithms can be found
 here.

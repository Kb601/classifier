research areas


virtual reality:
the main theme of this research area is the investigation of software tools
for the cost effective production of vr applications. at least some of
these tools should be usesable by non-programmers, enabling a wide range
of designers to create interesting vr applications.

the
mr toolkit: the mr toolkit is a set of software tools for the production
of vr applications that has been under development for the past 5 years.
this toolkit is freely distributed to non-commercial organizations, and
there are currently over 340 sites.

atm protocol
visualization: testing and evaluating atm networks can be a challenging
problem due to the large volume of data that can flow over a network connection.
it is possible to collect the data flowing over a network connection, but
analyzing this large volume of data requires visualization techniques that
allow engineers to view a significant portion of this data at various level
of detail.

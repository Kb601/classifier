 cornell robotics and vision laboratory


dan huttenlocher and i founded the

cornell robotics and vision laboratory  in 1991. 



research
my interests include

robotics, 

microelectromechanical systems,

geometric algorithms, and artificial intelligence. 

robotics is the science that seeks 
to forge an intelligent, computational connection between perception 
and action.

working with graduate student jim jennings, research associate  daniela
rus, graduate student 
russell brown, and lab alumnus  jonathan rees
(now at mit), we developed a  team of autonomous
mobile robots that can perform sophisticated  distributed manipulation tasks
(such as  moving furniture).  the robots run
robust spmd protocols that are completely asynchronous and require no
communication. with grad student  karl
b&ouml;hringer and ee professor noel macdonald, we are building a
 massively parallel array of microactuators in the
cornell national nanofabrication laboratory.  the array
is a scream chip containing over 11,000 actuators in 1 square
centemeter, and can orient small parts without sensory
feedback. our microfabricated actuator arrays could be used to
construct programmable parts-feeders (at any scale), or to build
self-propelled ic's (walking vlsi chips.)  graduate student  amy
briggs worked with dan huttenlocher's vision group to develop  a sensor planning and surveillance system for a team of
mobile robots. the robots use on-board vision to detect and
intercept targets in the lab.

mpeg video of tommy chasing lily. tommy and lily are  mobile robots we built. using algorithms developed
by the 
vision group in  our
lab, lily can track tommy and follow him, using visual information
alone. this video shows lily's view of the `chase.'

	the learning systems group at caltech works on the theory, 
implementation, and application of automated learning, pattern 
recognition, and neural networks.  we are an interdisciplinary 
group with students coming from electrical engineering, computer 
science, mathematics, and physics.  we work on a variety of projects 
analyzing and synthesizing systems that can be trained to perform 
their task.

	learning is a topic that can be approached from different 
angles.  for instance, one project deals with the rigorous mathematical
analysis of over-learning; when a system memorizes too much detail 
about a limited experience.  another project develops techniques for 
selecting high-level features for pattern recognition.  a third project 
applies learning to forecasting in the financial markets. 

	we have an on-going research effort in learning from hints 
which generalizes the basic learning from examples; paradigm.  learning 
from examples assumes that the function  we are trying to learn is 
represented to us by a training set of input/output examples, but is 
otherwise unknown.  this poses a dilemma:  we would like to use a 
learning model that is sophisticated enough to have a chance of 
implementing the unknown function, yet we want the model to be simple 
enough that a limited set of examples will suffice to tune it properly.

	hints come in as a learning aid to improve the situation.  we 
usually have, in addition to the set of examples of , some prior 
knowledge of certain facts about .  we wish to use this side information 
to our advantage.  for instance, we may know that  is scale-invariant and 
monotonic, and we want to put this information together with the training set 
of examples to come up with a good implementation of .  we want this process 
to be automated, so that the system is genuinely learning from hints.

	our group has pioneered the use of hints in learning, and we 
continue to work on all aspects of the technique.  the goal is to automate 
the use of hints to a degree where we can effectively utilize a large number 
of different hints that may be available in a practical situation.  we have 
also developed a theoretical analysis of learning from hints.  the analysis 
is based on the vapnik-chervonenkis dimension provides an estimate for the 
number of examples the system will need to learn .  

	the learning systems group is committed to the understanding of the 
fundamental components of automated learning, and to the development of 
real-life systems that utilize learning to achieve state-of-the art performance.

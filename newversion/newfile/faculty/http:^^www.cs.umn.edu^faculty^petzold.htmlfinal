research in the group of professor petzold is centered on the analysis
and development of numerical methods for differential equations and
differential-algebraic equation (dae) systems, scientific computing,
parallel computing and mathematical software.

differential equations and differential-algebraic systems arise in a
wide variety of scientific and engineering applications.
differential-algebraic equations often occur as differential equations
which are subject to constraints.  the constraints may be linear or
nonlinear, equality or inequality.  dae systems arise frequently as
initial value problems in the computer-aided design and modeling of
mechanical systems subject to constraints (multibody systems), circuit
simulation, flowsheeting for chemical processes, modeling of the flow
of incompressible fluids, and in many other applications.  boundary
value problems in daes arise in parameter estimation and control for
multibody systems and for chemical processes and determination of
periodic solutions for circuits.  the presence of the constraints in a
dae system leads to an interesting mathematical structure and presents
challenges for numerical algorithms.  current research focuses on
numerical methods for real-time simulation of mechanical systems,
parameter estimation and optimal control of differential-algebraic
systems, and parallel methods and software for very-large-scale
systems of daes in geophysics and other applications.

research interests

professor rebelsky's research interests include programming languages
(particularly lazy functional programming,
the use of term rewriting systems in programming, and
techniques for multi-paradigm programming), hypermedia (systems,
interfaces, and retrieval), and the use of computers in education.  
his thesis research was on the design and use of a demand-driven term-based
communication system.

vitae.



teaching

i'm teaching two courses this term: cs4, a survey
course intended for nonmajors and cs68, a 
majors-only course on programming languages.



i've taught a number of courses at dartmouth college and the university of chicago, including
introductory calculus, introductory programming (parts 1 and 2),
undergraduate programming langauges, graduate programming languages,
computer science for nonmajors, undergraduate operating systems and
undergraduate networking.



i also teach the occasional continuing education course, often on subjects
pertaining to electronic publishing.  these days, i've been teaching html
to a number of groups, and therefore maintain a rough collection of
online html references.  i'm also starting
to teach javascript to a number of people (primarily in preparation for
using it in our nonmajors course) and have created some
javascript reference materials and examples.



fun

i'll admit that most of my free time is spent with my wife and new son
(born july 31, 1996)


on a completely separate note, also maintain the
jonathan richman faq, but i
haven't had a lot of time for that in recent months.


i also waste my free time collecting music (my tastes vary -- roots rock,
singer-songwriters, power pop, great boston bands, ...).  one great place
to look for independent music on the net is 
the indie ocean, and
i'm not saying that just because they bribed me to.  they carry lots of
great boston-based musicians, like barrence whitfield and robin lane.



disclaimer

this is not a fancy page (but you could tell that).  this is because i
am a strong proponent of logical markup, rather than
physical markup.  that is, i believe most html authors should
place emphasis on indicating the role of each piece of text, 
rather than the appearance of that text.

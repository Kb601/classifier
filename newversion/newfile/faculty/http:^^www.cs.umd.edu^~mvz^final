recent research interests and published papers: 
    


webme. webme is a web-based
data visualization tool that is an extension to sme, software management
environment, of nasa's flight dynamics division and the software engineering
laboratory. it allows data from several projects to be graphically displayed
in various ways and to plot underlying models of the data.



 software engineering environments. 
understanding the structure of software engineering environments from
the set of infrastructure services needed to support program development to
the set of end user application services needed to support various application
domains.



 formal methods.  understanding the
role of formal models for software engineering technology is important in 
developing the appropriate technology.
    


 technology transfer.  
understanding how organizations, such as nasa

e.g., nasa/gsfc software engineering laboratory,  develop and understand
new technology. how one experiments to validate software engineering claims.



 program measurement.
various activities for the development of an experimental science for
software engineering and for the development of quantitative models of the
programming process.
    


 books and other software engineering issues. 
odds and ends in the field of software engineering.

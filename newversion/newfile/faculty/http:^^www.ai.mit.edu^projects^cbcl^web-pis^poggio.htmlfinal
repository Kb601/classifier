tomaso poggio, co-director, cbcl. 


 
tomaso poggio co-director, center for biological & computational
learning. 

currently uncas and helen whitaker professor in the
department of brain and cognitive sciences at the massachusetts
institute of technology and a member of the mit artificial
intelligence laboratory., professor poggio received his ph. d. from
the university of genoa in theoretical physics, and was a member of
the max-planck institute fuer biologische kybernetik, germany.

professor poggio worked on the visual system of the fly with w.
reichardt and with d. marr on computational analysis of human and
machine vision. more recently, professor poggio's work has focused on
networks for learning, developing theoretical foundations,
applications and neurobiological connections. please click here to visit prof. poggio's  homepage.

research interests:

design and evaluation of systems and networks

principal investigator for the 
maruti project


the major thrust of my research over the last few years has been to 
understand the role of time in the design and implementation of computer 
systems.  i am examining the issues of representation, management and 
manipulation of time in systems.  one context of this study is the design 
and implementation of the advanced hard real-time which we are 
undertaking in the maruti project.  the goal of the maruti project is to 
create an environment for the development and deployment of applications 
with hard real-time systems, fault tolerance, and security requirements.  
such applications must be able to execute on a distributed, heterogeneous 
hardware base.  during the past five years, we have created a framework 
for such an environment and have demonstrated the feasibilty of the 
design through implementations of the prototype of the maruti environment.

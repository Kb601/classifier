a few of my selected papers are available
by ftp.
i also have a description
 of a task-oriented parallel abstraction,
along with software, related papers, abstract, and large computations
carried out using that abstraction.

among recent and current projects,
i was involved (with g. michler) in organizing a workshop on

high performance computing and gigabit local area networks
in essen from april 29 to may 3, 1996

(also see european copy).  i am organizing
east coast computer algebra day (eccad-97) in spring, 1997.
i am on the program committee for 
hpdc-6 (high performance and distributed computing, aug. 5 - 8, 1997;
cf. also 
hpdc-5 program (1996)).
this fall quarter three of us are leading a seminar
in distributed systems.  this fall, i am also teaching a graduate course
on computer architecture.

other random pointers of interest to me follow.

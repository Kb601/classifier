the strategic goal of our research is to contribute to the development of a 
comprehensive theory of computational complexity.  computational complexity 
is the study of the quantitative laws that govern computation, and it is an 
essential part of the science base needed to guide, harness, and exploit 
the explosively growing computer technology.  computational complexity 
classifies problems by the amounts of various computational resources 
needed to solve them.  this classification yields complexity classes, each 
of which consists of all problems that can be solved within a given 
computational resource bound.  to gain a deeper understanding of what makes 
problems hard to compute, we explore various complexity classes, relations 
between these classes, and the internal structure of these classes.  we 
also study the trade-offs between different computational resources in 
problem solving, with particular attention to sequential-time, 
parallel-time, nondeterministic-time, memory requirements, randomness as a 
computational resource, and interactive computing.

home page: yale n. patt




(or, at least my first attempt at this.  i have finally succumbed to all that insistance that i must
have a home page, so here goes.  with a little effort, this might work itself into reasonable
shape.  we'll see.)




professor of electrical engineering and computer science 
university of michigan, ann arbor


actually, i do have a  more nearly current picture, 
which was taken in a museum in cyprus in june, 1995 by greg egan, professor at
monash university.




once i get things straightened out, there will be links to:

 eecs 100, a serious introduction 
to computer science and computer engineering for
undergraduate majors in computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering.
 hps: my research group.
 our industrial affiliates program in the computer science division at michigan ipocse.
 a reasonably current cv, in ascii, suitable for reading.  postscript is available for the asking.
 my views on education.
 my views on computer architecture.
 other recent drivel that i have generated and feel compelled to share with you.




i can be reached at patt@eecs.umich.edu or via telephone at 313-936-1602,
or by contacting my secretary michelle chapman at 313-764-4329,

research interests

my research lies in computational linguistics and natural language
processing.  i am currently working on ways to represent meaning from
texts and to link meaningful segments via semantic nets.  i have been
involved in the text encoding initiative, an sgml based set of
guidelines for indepth text representation, which has led me to be
interested in mark-up languages in general.  i am also working on ways
to automatically determine lexical information via statistical means
over parsed texts.  prior to arriving at columbia, i spent nearly ten
years at the tj waston ibm research division, where i worked on
extracting information from machine-readable dictionaries.  i have
also worked on speech synthesis and text-to-speech systems.

the kinds of systems that have used the results of my research have
been: natural language parsers, machine translation systems, and text
critiquing systems.

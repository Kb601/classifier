software generation is a key to improved programmer productivity, reduced 
maintenance costs, and enhanced application performance. i and my students 
are investigating ways to realize practical, domain-specific component-based 
design methodologies and technologies for large scale software system 
synthesis. this spans the topics of: software architectures, design patterns, 
extensible languages, subjectivity, domain modeling, parameterized 
programming, object-oriented programming, frameworks. the domains of 
current interest are database management, data structures, and avionics.
my current research is building a programming language to support software 
generation. the goal of the jakarta project is to build an extensible preprocessor for the java language. 
domain-specific generators would be encapsulated, pluggable extensions to jakarta.
research funding is from darpa, microsoft research, the university of texas applied research 
laboratories, and schlumberger.

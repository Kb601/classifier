my main research interest is in the area of knowledge
representation and reasoning systems. i am particularly interested
in developing techniques for declaratively representing different
kinds of knowledge, for efficient (exact as well as approximate)
deductive reasoning with it, and for revising and integrating
knowledge from possibly-conflicting sources. due to the general
applicability of this topic, i am interested in several other areas as
well, including deductive and object-oriented databases, logic
programming, automated reasoning, artificial intelligence, rewriting
systems, complexity theory, and software engineering. applications
include intelligent generation of multimedia for healthcare user
interfaces.

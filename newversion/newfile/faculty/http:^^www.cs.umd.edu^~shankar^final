email: shankar@cs.umd.edu


current position: associate professor of computer science


 joint appointment:  umiacs

academic degree: ph.d., university of texas at austin, 1982







distributed algorithms course (cmsc 712, fall 96) 



solution to hw 3 and hw 4 (including "corrected" problem 2) 



research assistantships




research interests:
the design and analysis of distributed systems
and network protocols,
from both correctness and performance aspects.

my current work is on:




assertional methods for concurrent/realtime systems,
particularly layered systems as found in operating systems
and networking.


the z-iteration,
a numerical method for fast performance prototyping
of adaptive high-performance systems,
such as integrated-services networks.
the z-iteration provides accurate time evolutions
of probabilistic measures
at a cost several orders cheaper than simulation.



recent work includes
minimal latency transport protocols,
scalable tos/policy routing,
mars routing testbed,
link-state vs distance-vector routing.

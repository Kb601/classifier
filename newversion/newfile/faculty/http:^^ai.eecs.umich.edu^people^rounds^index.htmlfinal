research activities

i'm a theoretical computer scientist interested in ai.  my research 
involves mostly the subject called  of mathematics of language
the general idea is to make mathematical models of linguistic entities, ranging
from grammars to semantics to pragmatics. i try to use the sophisticated tools
of theoretical computer science to do this.
 this involves logic, automata theory,
and tools from the semantics of programming langauges.
see my  research statement for more information.

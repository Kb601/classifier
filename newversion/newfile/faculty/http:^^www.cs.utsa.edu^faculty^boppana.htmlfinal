 summary of research
i am interested in integrating the access of nonlocal data and message
routing in multicomputers and distributed shared memory multiprocessors.
current directory based cache protocols are not designed to exploit
multicast hardware that is likely to be provided in future wormhole routers.
i am currently investigating new cache protocols to take advantage of
network abilities and new routing protocols that support cache coherence
and synchronization traffic efficiently.  one possible solution may lead
to the design of integrated router and cache controllers.  in my recent
work, i have investigated methods to enhance known wormhole routing algorithms
to handle faults, deadlock issues in multicast communication, and design of
new wormhole routing algorithms.  i am applying my results on fault-tolerant
and multicast communication to current router designs such as the multichip
routers implemented in cray t3d(tm) to study the design of next generation
routers and switch fabrics for high-speed local area networks.

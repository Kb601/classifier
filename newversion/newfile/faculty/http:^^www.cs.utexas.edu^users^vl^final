vladimir lifschitz

when feeling burdened or downcast,... the human mind will gladly turn to the
realms of mathematics, where a lucid and precise grasp of objectivities is
obtained and insight is gained so pleasantly through appropriate concept
formation.  here the human spirit feels at home. -- paul bernays, 1955

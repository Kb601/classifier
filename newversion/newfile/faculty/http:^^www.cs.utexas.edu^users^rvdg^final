summary of research

the introduction of parallel computers has forced a re-evaluation of
traditional numerical methods that were developed for sequential
machines. in some cases, the techniques continue to be useful; in
other cases, new methods may prove to perform better. my research
concentrates on the development of parallel techniques for
implementing numerical methods as well as an environment that allows
such methods to be easily implemented on various parallel
processors.

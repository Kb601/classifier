research interests:


computer architecture and back-end compilation, with an emphasis on
experimental performance analysis.  current work is on issues in
compiler optimizations (dynamic compilation, shared data optimizations
and instruction scheduling) and processor design (multithreaded
architectures).






current research projects:




 
compile-time algorithms to reduce false sharing

 
dynamic compilation

 
multithreaded architectures

  spin






previous research:




 
cache coherency 

 
code scheduling 

 
compile-time prefetching on shared memory machines 

 
miscellaneous 

 
tools and workload

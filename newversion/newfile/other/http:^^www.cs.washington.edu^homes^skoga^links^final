links to the web

i'm kinda infamous for liking to go out onto the web in search of
'cool things.'  in fact, though i web-browse less than most people, i
do find lots of really interesting things from my travails, and here
are some of them.  this is by no means complete, as i've got a hotlist
that's close to 400 links long!  i'm currently trying to pick out
which ones deserve to stick around, and here are a few of my more
favorite sites that i have gone through so far.  you may note that
there is some duplication; that's because some sites may belong to
more than one category.  i also decided to bias the list here slightly
toward places that can serve documents quickly relative to the
university of virginia.  i hope that you find this useful in your
travels on the web.

if you have any comments, suggestions, etc., please mail me at
skoga@cs.washington.edu.  thanks!

you can also examine my current
netscape links.

countries and travel


this may require a little explanation.  if i find a link that has info
about a particular country, such as on culture, history, travel info,
etc., it's fairly coherent, and it's very good, then i may put it
here.  note that many of these links sound like advertisements; that's
because, in fact, many of these are, so take the info with a
grain (or lump) of salt.

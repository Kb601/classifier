copper and gold.







spinning gold, robert bryce, mother jones,
september-october, 1996.  "by keeping journalists away from its
indonesian mine--which contains gold, silver, and copper valued at $50
billion--new orleans-based freeport-mcmoran has managed to put its
spin on environmental and human rights abuses near the mine." 
freeport replies, mother jones, november-december, 1996.

   "tribal leaders and environmentalists claim the
mine in the rugged mountains is the source of tons of toxic wastes
that are killing portions of a river and acres of rain forest. many of
the tribes also complain that their land has been taken without
compensation by the indonesian government, and that human rights
activists have been abused and some even murdered by the indonesian
military." gold
and blood in the wilderness, cnn february 21, 1996.






"freeport's grasberg mine in the remote and rugged province is
`arguably the most valuable single mineral discovery ever made,'
(freeport vice-president) murphy told reuters in outlining current
exploration work."  reuter, october 9, 1996.




"probably everyone in austin has something from the freeport copper
mine in their house.  the mine is now producing about 8% of the
world's copper."  ut geological sciences department chairman mark cloos, oct. 6, 1996.

the faculty council meeting passed this resolution:


resolved, that the faculty council ask chancellor cunningham and
the board of regents to discuss with james robert and louise moffett
the possibility of their voluntarily assenting to a change in the
proposed name of the molecular biology building from the james robert
and louise moffett building.



in reaction to the faculty council resolution the deans' council issued a statement
asking the chancellor and board of regents not to seek a new name for
the building while law school dean sharlot charged that the faculty
council acted like a kangaroo court.

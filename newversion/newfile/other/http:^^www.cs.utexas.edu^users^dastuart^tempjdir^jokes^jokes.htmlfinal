the queen, the prince and the count of a small country, conspired to
gain control of the throne by assinating the king.  the count was
sent into the kings chamber one night and told to murder him
while he was sleeping.
the count, who was not very intelligent, slipped up and was caught
red handed in his attempt. the king knew very well that this man was
incapable of pulling this assination off by himself so he demanded, ``tell
me who is conspiring against me or i will have your head.''  the
count stayed silent.
the king rounded up the executioner and took the count down to the
chopping block.  the king said, ``i'll give you one last chance.
tell me who was in the conspiracy and i will spare your life.''  the
count refused to speak.
the king gave the signal to the excutioner and just as the axe was
being raised the count said, ``wait, wait, i'll talk!''  but it was to
late.  the executioner droped his axe and the count died.
the king, fuming mad screemed at the executioner, ``you fool! how
many times have i told you never to hatchet you counts befor they
chicken!''

wales suffers from a lack of vowels.  all the time you see signs like this:

llwlldlcndlwldllwldlldwldlwlc - 4 km

it's tragic to listen to welsh mothers teaching their children
traditional songs like ``old macdonald had a farm'' and lapsing
into heart-rending silence when they get to the ``e i e i o'' bit.

if any of you have surplus vowels, please send them to your local
vfw (vowels for wales) office.

        ``no, but i've often thought i'd like to.''
        ``well don't. it's a ghastly place. huge gangs of tough, sinewy men roam
the valleys, terrifying people with their close-harmony singing. you need half
a pint of phlegm in your throat just to pronounce the place names. never ask

     an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are sleeping in their
rooms when the building catches fire.  the engineer wakes up, smelling
smoke.  he runs to the bathroom and fills the wastebasket with water and
douses the flames, soaking the immediate area.

     the physicist wakes up, smelling smoke.  he grabs his calculator and
does a series of rapid calculations.  he then runs to the bathroom and
gets exactly the right amount of water to douse the flames without getting
anything else wet.

     the mathematician wakes up smelling smoke.  he walks into the bathroom
and fills a paper cup with water.  he then lights a match and pours the
water over it.  he then exclaims ``a solution exists!'', and goes back to bed.

        a mathematician, a chemist, a physicist, and an engineer were
        all asked the question: ``are all odd numbers other than 1 prime?''

        mathematician: ``well, 3 is prime. 5 is prime. 7 is prime. nine?
        nine isn't prime. counterexample!''

        chemist: ``3 is prime. 5 is prime. 7 is prime. nine? er, ah, um,
        9 is experimental error...''

        physicist: ``3 is prime. 5 is prime. 7 is prime. well, they must
        all be prime...''

        engineer: ``3 is prime. 5 is prime. 7 is prime. 9 is prime...''

computer programer: `` 3 is a prime. 3 is a prime. 3 is a prime. 3 is a
                    prime. ''

biologist: ``what is a prime anyway?''.

mathematician: `` 3 is a prime. 5 is a prime. 7 is a prime and the rest
               will be learned by induction.''

it seems that once upon a time stalin, khrushchev and brezhnev were all
travelling together on this train from moscow to vladivostok when,
at one point, the engines stuttered and the train came grinding to a halt.

two hours later, nothing more had happened; the train was still stopped.
stalin got up.  ``i'll take care of this.''
he went out and had all of the engineers and train-workers shot.
he came back into the compartment and sat back down.
``that should take care of it.''

two more hours passed; the train has not moved.
khrushchev got up.  ``i'll take care of this.''
he went out, found a few engineers hiding in the rear of the train,
and, after a while, managed to persuade them to start working on the
train again.  he came back into the compartment and sat down.
``that should take care of it.''

ten minutes later there was this loud groaning noise from the engines;
the train lurched forward and then came to a halt a few moments later.

nothing more happened for about an hour.
then brezhnev got up, drew the blinds, and sat down.

``now.  train is moving.''

several hundred years ago in north america, there lived a tribe of 
native americans.  it so happened that three young squaws of the tribe
found themselves expecting children.  it was their tradition that
the first surface touched by a new born baby should be that of an animal
skin procured for the occasion.  and so it happened that the three young
bucks responsible went out on a hunt for birthing skins for their squaws.

a few days later, the three men returned after a successful hunt with
their birthing skins and food for the tribe.  the first buck had bagged
a deer, and the second had killed a bear.  the third buck had spotted a
huge animal swimming in a river, and harvested a rare american hippopotamus.

more time passed, and the blessed events came, all at the same time.  the
three squaws prepared to give birth.  the first squaw gave birth to a
baby boy on the deer skin.  the second squaw gave birth to a baby girl
on the bear skin.  the third squaw gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl,
on the hippopotamus skin.

and so even in ancient america they knew that ... the squaw of the 
hippopotomus is equal the sum of the squaws of the other two hides.

referee's report on the bible

 in this work, the main author (god) gives a construction of the
universe, and establishes some of its metaphysical properties.
he refutes certain propositions claimed by beelzebub (proc. hades
philos. soc. 4004 b.c.) while at the same time placing the work
of his colleague christ in proper context. in the final section
certain conjectures are made as to the nature of future research.
i recommend publication, subject to certain revisions in the
early part, where some unnecessary duplication appears to have
taken place (cf. kings and chronicles).

a man walks into an auto parts store and says
``i'd like a rear view mirror for my yugo.''

the man behind the counter thinks about this for
a while, then says ``yup, seems like a fair trade to
me.''

``it has long been known...''
	i didn't bother to look up the original references.

``a definite trend is evident...''
	these data are practically meaningless....

``of great theoretical and practical importance...''
	interesting to me.

``while it has not been possible to provide definite answers to 
these questions....''
	an unsuccessful experiment, but i still hope to get it
	published.

``three of the samples were chosen for detailed study...''
	the results of the other didn't make any sense.

``typical results are shown...''
	the best results are shown.

``these results will be shown in a subsequent report...''
	i might get around to this if i'm pushed.

``it is believed that...''
	i think.

``it is generally believed that...''
	a couple of other guys think so, too.

``it is clear that much additional work will be required before 
a complete understanding of the phenomena occurs...''
	i don't understand it, nobody else could explain it
	to me, but it should produce quite few publications.

``correct within the limits of experimental accuracy...''
	wrong. i fitted the curve to the best known experimental
	results.

``it is hoped that this study will stimulate further investigation
	in this field...''
	this is a lousy paper, but so are all the others
	on this miserable topic.

``a careful analysis of the obtainable data...''
	three pages of the notes were obliterated when i knocked over
	a glass of beer.

  a texan was showing a tourist san antonio.  ``over there, you will find the
alamo, where 180 brave texans held off 20,000 mexican troops for 8 days.  and
over there, you will find a statue of a texas ranger.  he was directly
responsible for the apprehension of over 40 outlaws and singlehandedly broke
up four riots. and over there...''
  ``well, i'm from boston,'' the tourist interrupted, ``and we have our heros
there, too.  take paul revere for instance...''
  ``paul revere?!'' snorted the texan, ``you mean that guy who had to ride for
help?''

mommy, mommy, what's a werewolf?

	a while ago i saw a posting here about user hostile hardware/software.
this is not a reposting.  i just happened to develop this after i wrote my
first user-hostile (real) lisp program.  i would like to acknowledge the help
of eric hollander who contributed some ideas.

	i would also like to note that none of this is based on my experience
with the apollo hp's that our ocf (open computing facility) received as a
donation from hp.  in my opinion, apollos are the greatest workstations
around.  there is absolutely nothing wrong with them (honest!!!).  i think we
truly got our money's worth.

			user hostile

	r&amp;r software yesterday announced the introduction of a new concept in
software/hardware development:  user hostility.  among their new
developments:

a) the attack mouse (tm):  basically, the only difference between other
commercial mouse systems and this one is that the attack mouse transmits a 220
volt current to the user at random intervals.

b) numerical commands:  all commands in r&amp;r operating systems will be
numerical.  'ls' for example, will be '000539.' flags will be designated as
decimals, so, for instance, 'ls -sfta' will be '000539.497387292100'.  each
flag will be 3 decimal spaces long.

c) recursive manual pages:  r&amp;r announced that their manual pages will be
recursive.  as a typical example, the manual page for ls will be:

ls(1)				r&amp;r					ls(1)

name

	000539 - list contents of directory

synopsis

	see 'man 000539'

description

	see 'man 000539'

d) longer manual pages:  with the exception of recursive manual pages (tm),
manual pages installed on r&amp;r machines will be approximately 120kb long.  this
will lead, an r&amp;r representative predicted, to the gravitation of the
utilization of their machines to users who are ``trully dedicated to the task
of deciphering cryptic manual pages.''

e) sponteneous password changes:  in r&amp;r's multi-user systems (vax's and
workstations), passwords will be changed automatically by the machine every 7
days.  this, said an r&amp;r representative, will ultimately lead to the
continuous password (tm), that will change automatically whenever a command is entered.

f) cruciality-based crashing:  the new r&amp;r workstations will feature a device
that will measure how important the task being done is to its owner, and how
crucial it is that it be finished within a certain period of time.  whenever
the importance/crucialityrating of the total tasks being performed on the 
workstation passes a certain point (randomly selected by the machine), the
machine will automaticaly crash.

g) user-hostile software and operating systems:  r&amp;r plans many developments
in this area, including:
   1)  a standard error message (i.e.  rtfm asshole!!)
   2)  humiliation software:  where, upon choosing different options, the user
       is humiliated by the software (i.e. ``you're a loser--a disgrace to your 
       country'' in case a user wishes to exit a program).
   3)  utilization of racial slurs.

h) sponteneous deletion of all files:  if a certain user does not log on
within 7 days of the last logoff, that user is assumed to have died and all of
his/her files will be deleted.  in addition, any attempt to login as that user
will be treated as an impersonation, and the machine will utilize a 2000 volt
electric current to discourage further attempts.

i) fake mail:  the machines will randomly generate easily-detected fake mail
from various users addressed to root.  r&amp;r assures us, though, that the
machines will also automatically correct the problem by turning off those
users accounts for suspicion of sending fake mail.

	overall, this new generation of software/hardware promises to be a
giant leap backwards to the days of ibm.

what is the difference between a dead skunk in the middle of the
road and a dead lawyer in the middle of the road?  the are skid
marks in front of the skunk!

what's black and brown and looks good on a lawyer?  a doberman.

what do you call 2000 attorneys chained to the bottom of the sea? 
a good start.

how can you tell if your lawyer is lying?  his lips are moving.

why don't lawyers go to the beach?  the cats keep trying to bury
them.

a lawyer was asked if he wanted to become a jehovah's witness.  he
declined, as he hadn't seen the accident but would still be
interested in taking the case.

why does california have more lawyers than new jersey has toxic
waste dumps?  new jersey had first choice.

what's the difference between a porcupine and two attorneys in a
porsche?  with a porcupine, the pricks are on the outside.

standing around the grave of a departed friend are an
anthropologist, and doctor, and a lawyer.

when the eulogies are over, the anthropologist suggests that they
all put some money in the coffin, as is the custom of some ancient
tribes she has been studying.

the anthropologist pulls out a $100 bill and deposits it in the
coffin.  not to be outdone, the doctor also pulls out a $100 bill
and lays it in the coffin.

the lawyer writes a check for $300, puts it in the coffin, and
removes the $200 cash.

and then there's the lawyer who, when stepping in cow shit,
thought he was melting.

this provocative new book series provides amazingly arbitrary
explanations to events which lie entirely within ordinary reality.
just listen to some of the stories described within ...

o  in malibu, ca, a woman suddenly feels that her grandson in new york
has just received a phone call bringing terrible news.  she places a
frantic, long distance call ... and *the line is busy*.
			              ...it's dismissed as coincidence

o  a group of youths in a wooded clearing are held aloft by an unseen force.
they report hearing ``wow, like, really freaky noises, man.''
			              ...it's dismissed as ``bad'' acid

o  as reported by dozens of observers, numerous glowing lights appear in the
night sky over denver, remaining until dawn.
			              ...it's dismissed as stars

o  in lynchburg, va, a man sticks a fork in a toaster when suddenly a bolt
of energy shoots up his arm, knocking him unconscious.  
			              ...it's dismissed as stupidity

we can no longer afford to ignore things which may not be complete
fabrications.  act now and you'll receive the exciting first book,
``things that go bump in the night.''  after that, you'll receive one
book per month.  if you don't want it, send it back within 30 seconds
for a full refund.  many exciting titles await, from ``spooky noises'' to
``how to tell if you're really from another planet.''

each book is$89.90, billable in 10 monthly installments of

only$8.99 each!!

(the pbs ``american masters'' series did a show on mort sahl, who had
these anecdotes about alexander haig:)

haig offerred sahl a cuban cigar, whereupon sahl wondered how an
anti-communist such as haig could be supporting cuba by smoking their
cigars.  haig replied that he preferred to think of it as burning their
crops to the ground.

sahl and haig were discussing henry kissinger.  sahl mentioned that, of
course, kissinger could not be the us president since he was not born
in the us.  haig said, no, that's a common misconception, kissinger was
born in the us.  ``how did he get that accent?'' asked sahl.  haig
replied, ``from never listening to anybody.''

how to write a rap / house(glorified disco) / disco song

lyrics:
simply take one word or phrase from each of the three columns below, in order
to make one line.  repeat randomly four times.  repeat process again twice
to make chorus.  repeat last line 17 times.  don't worry if they don't make
sense.

column 1		column 2		column 3

move it			triple beat		the city streets
get up			body heat		you'll be humpin
pump it up		feel the beat		before the night is over
get down		get around		shake your meat
shake it		the joint is jumpin	bustin loose
pump the jam		feet are stompin	disco heat

backbeat:
program a drum machine in neverending 4/4 time.  add occasional snare.

body:
add monotonous bass in one key.  overlay with puncy sounding synth.  get
previously unknown singer to talk the lyrics so as not to test the range
of the vocal chords.

production:
put above ingredients together on master tape.  press discs.  give the label
a suitably techno-funk sounding name, like ``mixmastermeatbeaters''.  sell 5
million copies to unsuspecting public.  win mtv award.

the sad thing is the public will *think* you've been creative...

better still, this process can be automated via a lyric c program, a random 
synth base and music generator, and the discs mastered directly by computer
control.

this relieves the composer of decisions regarding which phrases and notes
to use in production.  by pressing the &lt;ret&gt; key, more than 100 cd's a week
can be generated.

this i have done, below is a sample composition guaranteed to make megabucks:

-----
``get down'' by mixmastermeatbeaters

get down the joint is jumpin' you'll be humpin'
shake it feet are stompin' in the city streets
pump the jam feel the beat with disco heat
move it get around 'til the night is over

(chorus)
get down to triple beat shake your meat
pump it up get around in the city streets

pump the jam to triple beat you'll be humpin'

the heaviest element known to science was discovered at the lawrence
livermore national laboratory.  the element, tentatively named administratum
(ad), has no protons or electrons.  thus it has the atomic number 0.  it
does, however, have one neutron, 75 associate neutrons, 125 deputy associate
neutrons, and 111 assistant deputy neutrons.  the 312 particles are held
together in the nucleus by a force that involves the continuous exchange of
meson-like particles called memons.

since it has no electrons, administratum is inert.  nevertheless, it can be
detected chemically because it seems to impede every reaction in which it
takes part.  according to dr. langour, one of the discoverers of the element,
a very small amount of administratum made one reaction that normally takes
less than a second, take over four days to go to completion.

administratum has a half-life of approximately three years, at which time it
does not actually decay.  instead, it undergoes an internal reorganization in
which associates to the neutron, deputy associates to the neutron, and
assistant deputy associate neutrons all exchange places.  some studies have
indicated that the atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization.

there has been criticism of the government for not anticipating
the iraqi invasion of kuwait.  for the future use of diplomats here
are three warning signs of possible invasion.

1)  many men in uniform with guns mass along the border of a country.

2) the leader of that country has a mustache.

3) the man with the mustache makes speeches about how the
neighboring country has really belonged to his for hundreds of years.

the front cover of the magazine private eye in the uk recently
had a photograph of saddam hussein saying,

``... and if anyone else compares me to hitler, i'll gas them.''

sadaam hussein assumed the presidency of iraq by killing his
predecessor.  his predecessor did the same.  obviously in iraq
they have a ``one bullet, one vote'' system.

in a recent news conference, president bush was asked how long he thought
the middle east crisis would last.  bush replied, ``as long as you remember
the s&amp;l crisis.''

duct tape is like the force!  it has a light side and a
dark side and holds the universe together.

``rushdie'' comes
from an ancient sanskrit dialect and means one who is in a hurry to die.

         your friend!''

 her gynacologist had a stroke.

 other statistically unsound shortcuts i use for avoiding dreck:

  o  if the book is part of a series (and what isn't, these days?)
     then the more pretentious and long-winded the series name is,
     the less likely i am to examine the book (e.g., ``first in the
     epic rolfe throgsneck-bridge of of des moine, iowa, saga'').

  o  if the name of the actual author either doesn't appear at all on
     the cover, or is in smaller print than the name of some other
     author who didn't have much or anything to do with writing the
     book, flush it.  likewise, if the cover says something like ``a
     &lt;fill in the name&gt; production'' (like, who the hell is bill
     fawcett, anyway?).

  o  if the blurb appears to be from somewhere in the left-field
     bleachers, forget it (e.g., william shatner's endorsement on the
     cover of the novelization of ``voice of the planet'').

  o  and -- and i know that this one is really problematical -- if
     i look at the front cover, the back cover and the inside front
     blurb pages and i see a zillion endorsements from other authors
     and/or clips from favorable reviews, but nothing at all about
     what the book itself is actually about, i generally pitch it
     on the grounds of a deeply felt moral conviction that the
     publisher is under an obligation to at least give me some sort
     of clue...

	i can't be too critical on cover blurb hunters.  i usually go by 
authors and then by friends' suggestions (i'm fortunate enough to have lots
of friends who say, ``you haven't read  bulgi of the zuccini people ?  you 
heathen!'').
	as for blurbs, i've gotten a good indication of what they mean by 
looking at several books.  each author's blurb usually means more or less  
the same thing.  for example:

steven king -- ``mort bloodsucker is the new master of horror!  remember, it's 
mort bloodsucker, not steven king, mort bloodsucker.  keep that in mind, and 
maybe, for once, i can appear on a magazine cover without being photographed in
a dark room with a flashlight shining up my fucking neck.''

isaac asimov -- `` the toad returns  is a wonderful book.  well, really, i 
haven't read it, but the guy who wrote it is polite enough, and i think he's 
my publisher's nephew.''

spider robinson -- [i have no idea what a spider robinson review means.  how an 
intelligent man, skilled writer, and reliable critic can say that craig shaw 
gardner is a good writer is beyond me.]

roger zelazny -- ``this book is'' [pause, checks random adjective generator] 
``engrossing.''

ursula k. leguin -- ``he (or she) writes a lot like i do.''

anne mccaffrey: kitchen maids of pern

bitsella is just a lowly kitchen drudge until she discovers that her green
firelizard has the ability to vibrate her wings at *just* the right frequency
to cause dirt to fall off of pots and pans -- a discovery that leads to
adventure and romance.

beginning a new shared-world series about the galaxy's toughest mercenaries.
only these superbly trained and lavishly equipped specialists are allowed to

important armies.  in this first adventure they travel back to the fifteenth
century in an attempt to eliminate the duchy of grand fenwick.

harlan ellison and philip jose farmer: a few more dangerous visions

working with a couple of dozen co-authors is a sure way to fall behind 
schedule, as harlan ellison has discovered.  now, with the aid of philip
jose farmer, who has had more experience at this, he turns to coauthoring
stories with writers who are dead, and hence much easier to work with.

jack chalker: out of body

in a radical departure, science fiction author jack chalker turns to fantasy
in this new series.  the city of wallawash is ruled by an incorporeal elite:
a race of symbionts capable of possessing and modifying a human body.  but
now some humans are finding themselves *dispossessed*, their consciousness
transfered to other bodies.

david eddings: the anacreon

the dark prophecy has been defeated, the two stones have been merged into a
single crystal, and the child of darkness has been rescued.  but a newly-
discovered prophecy reveals that the dark prophecy will have one more chance.
indeed, before it can be prevented, it strikes from the afterlife, stealing
the crystal.  to recover it, belgarion must lead a party to heaven (maps of
which are provided in the book).

well, go ahead and call me a dweeb, but i find blurbs very helpful
in choosing which new sf books to buy.  however, they need a certain
kind of reading...

for instance, here's a typical account of an expedition to the local
waldendeadtrees in search of mindless escapism:

[hmm, what's new this week.  ah, here's one]

	the dark lord returns

	thousands of years ago, the wise bound the dark lord under
mount dormor and set the seven wardstones to guard him.  but the old
magic has long gone, the wards are failing, and evil powers are again
abroad in the world.  in this time of crisis, all the free peoples -
elves, dwarves, men, even the little furry-footed halfwits - must
band together...

[wait a minute, i read that wrong, somewhere.  back up a bit]

	...even the little furry-footed halbwirs - must band together...

[well, cute i suppose, but the first reading was better after all]

	... and defend the west from the return of lord grimmoire.
thus begins a magnificent new fantasy trilogy, in the great tradition...

[oh, dear, that's two of the dreaded t-words, brace yourself for the
 big one, robert]

	... of donaldson and t*lk**n...

[aaargh! there it is.  drop book immediately, wipe green slime from
 fingers, and press on... now, how about this one...]

	things will get rather nasty
	book five: eridani encounter

	the human race had long since beaten its swords into
plowshares, and war was an ugly memory.  but then, when the first
starships tunneled through infraspace, they found that the rest
of the universe wasn't so nice.  suddenly, the terrans had to
reinvent soldiers, strategy and spam all over again, and in a
big hurry, before the aliens found them.

the earlier books told how captain grunt pulled together an
assorted gang of criminals, misfits and rebels, and created
earth's first fighting force.  now they are exploring the
limits of known space, when suddenly they encounter an awesome
battlecruiser of unknown origin and intentions...

[yawn.  another piece of badly-written soft-core machiography
 from dave duck and co.  can this tripe and press on.  hey,
 here's a new one ... great-looking cover, too...]

	oath of the sword

	since her mother's death three years before, sixteen-year-old
hissyfit had managed the castle all by herself - although the duke,
her father, never seemed to notice.  but only her supervision got
the tapestries mended, the lamps trimmed, the huge meals served to
the noble guests in the great hall, the pools of vomit cleaned up
the next day.  and after all, isn't that what a girl is supposed to
do?  and, after her father marries her off to some convenient local
landowner, won't she do just the same in her own castle?

so why does she dream about running away, and feel strange urges
to steal her grandfather's ugly black sword, dress in low-cut chain
mail, and ride around the countryside hacking people into small
pieces?  what is wrong with her, anyway?

then her orderly life changes, when she meets eggnog, who is one of
the famous messengers of maldemer, and is tall, handsome, saturnine,
dark-haired, limpid-brown-eyed, and *frightfully* good in bed, and
who rides the intelligent telepathic horse stomper, who is tall,
handsome, limpid-brown-eyed, - and no, the story doesn't get that
kinky, but stay tuned for the sequel, girls, because you never know...

[oh, dear.  no way will i pay $4.95 (plus tax) for this rubbish.
 instead, i'll show it to my teenage daughter, let her spend $4.95
 (plus tax), and then borrow it...  guess that's it for now... wait!
 there's one more, down on the bottom shelf...]

	flight from freedonia

	jack kvetch was just an ordinary, incompetent small-town
reporter who drank too much and wrote too little.  then he fell
through the strange disk of light that appeared behind his favorite
topless bar.  so how did he get here, in a stolen airship heading
west, with the garrulous fu tseng, sacked court poet of the king
of hawaii, and the dizzy nymphet who might, or might not, be the
grand duchess of russian america?  and behind him somewhere are the
secret police of emperor hamilton vi, who would like to get their
hands on his marvellous .45 revolver, and on as much as he knows of
the alien technology that produced it.  and where are the rebel
jeffersonians, and what will *they* want from him?

[wow, a new parallel-worlds yarn from hank turtleneck!  feeding frenzy!!]

of course, your tastes and mileage may differ, but i find blurbs almost
as much fun as many books.

moebius story

  it consists of the phrase ``once upon a
  time '' on one side of a strip of paper and ``there was a story which
  began'' on the other side, and the instruction to cut the strip out,
  give it a half twist, and tape the ends together

   wouldn't it turn upside down every 10 words? silliest story i ever heard of.

  come on, what's a story without a few plot twists?

``they'' reinstalled the news posting program in the department.  before,
when you posted an article, it said something like:

``this program posts news to thousands of machines all around the world.
your message will cost the net hundreds if not thousands of dollars.
are you sure you want to do this?''

but *now* it says, and i'm not making this up:

``this program posts news to billions of machines throughout the galaxy.
your message will cost the net enough to bankrupt your entire planet,
and as a result your species will be sold into slavery.  be sure you know
what you are doing.''

oh my...and since i just posted this, i must appologize to the human race...

oh come on, ``brock'' is totally letter-sweater ivy.

irene o'connell, a spunky, vivacious redhead, smiled as brock manley,
the dashing blond captain of the lacrosse squad, pulled up in his
jalopy outside the sorority house.  ``hi brock!'' she waved.  brock was
not only handsome, athletic, and a real gentleman, but he was secretly
very sensitive; only irene had seen the first chapter of his ``novel,''
and she could tell he had a bright future in the writing game.  plus
he had thews like brick. . . thews.  irene flushed.  ``leroy,'' she
called, fanning herself, to the grotesque, aged, mysterious hunchback
who inexplicably served as the sorority's handyman, factotum and
whipping boy, ``please get mr. manley and myself an orangeade.''  little
did she dream that she and brock would soon be plunged by the
enigmatic leroy into a whirlpool of macabre and life-threatening
intrigue, suspicion and romance.

``hiya, 'reenie!'' brock twinkled good-naturedly as he leapt onto the
sun porch.  ``sure is hot!''

brock.  a name for the nineties.

killed your family, and burned it down.&quot;  the violist replied, &quot;you're
kidding!  the conductor came to my house?&quot;

a violist is sitting in the front row, crying hysterically.  the conductor
askes the violist, &quot;what's wrong?&quot;  the violist answers, &quot;the second oboe
loosened one of my tuning pegs.&quot;  the conductor replied, &quot;i admit, that
seems a little childish, but nothing to get so upset about.  why are you
crying?&quot;  to which the violist replied, &quot;he won't tell me which one!!&quot;

self help book: women who love men who hate women and
the men who love them to hate them

a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho.  on the way he fell
among thieves, who took all his goods, beat him savagely and left him
dying by the wayside.

as it happend on that same day two social workers passed that way, and
looking upon him were filled with pity and concern.  whereupon one
turned to the other and said

        ``the person who did this needs our help!''

a sunday school teacher was telling her class about noah and his
adventures in the arc.

``so do you think noah did a lot of fishing?'', she asked the
class.

``how could he,'' said one bright girl, ``with only two worms?''

after a few minutes of viewing (covington cross),
i decided the premise of the show
had to be: &quot;what if modern american kids were raised by a medieval
lord?&quot;.    :-)  you know, sort of a &quot;leave it to genevieve&quot; or
&quot;arthur knows best&quot; or &quot;bonanzelot&quot;.

i'm reminded of a passage from asimov's (rather lengthy) autobiography.  he
and his daughter have just finished watching &quot;fantastic voyage&quot;.

&quot;but daddy, won't the submarine expand later and kill the man?&quot;
&quot;well, yes, robyn, but you have to understand that you're more intelligent
than the average hollywood producer.  after all, you're eight.&quot;

     on your favorite station

     we didn't start the series, 
     but when we are gone it will 
     still be on and on and on...

     we didn't start the series...

  

&quot;twenty years of pointy ears&quot;
(sung to the tune of &quot;when johnny comes marching home again&quot;)

 
from sixty-six to sixty-nine 
          there was a show 
     about the starship enterprise 
          as we all know 
     with funny ears, and beetle boots, 
          and phaser guns that we could shoot, 
     but trek... got... canned... 
          'cause the ratings were so low.

     letters from the fans didn't get 
          the show's fourth season on, 
     the star trek crew, now unemployed, 
          made cash at sci-fi cons. 
     when the ranks of trekkies grew and grew, 
          we noticed that some fans do to, 
     'cause they nibble... just like tribbles... 
          while they're watching trek re-runs.

     the fans all got together for 
          a new write-in campaign, 
     to get a tv movie made, 
          but not one like &quot;spock's brain&quot;! 
     the network told them &quot;go to hell!&quot;, 
          but then found star trek toys sold well; 
     but there's... no... mar... ket 
          in sci-fi films today.

     (just then when things seemed darkest, 
      there was a light... saber.)

     the highest grossing movie in the 
          world is called star wars; 
     they read through the old star trek scripts, then 
          wrote one that's a bore. 
     star trek: the motion picture's trash, but 
          it should make a lotta cash: 
     the crew will wear pajamas 
          and we'll make one of them bald.

     (it's making money!  quick!  let's make a sequel!) 
     &lt;well, we have this other old script called... what is it?&gt; 
     (space seed?) 
     &lt;yeah, ricardo montalban just happens to be on the back lot doing a 
          cordoba commercial -- [de plane! de plane!] -- so you know what 
          that means, don't you?&gt;

     star... trek... two!!!

     we'll kill off khan, and kill off spock, and 
          make them cry, you'll see! 
     we'll sell them star trek handkerchiefs, and 
          then make star trek three! 
     kirk has a wife, and has a son; we'll 
          sell them dolls of everyone. 
     janiss... iss... is a bomb that's lots of fun. 
     ... unlike star trek one.

     (shut up!)

     hey, wait a minute, looky here, there's 
          money to be made 
     on model kits and other shit like 
          gum cards they can trade; 
     they'll wonder if spock's dead, ya see; we'll 
          sell the rights to pay tee vee, 
     and with... the... mo... ney, we'll make star trek three.

     (great.  just great.  now nimoy won't come back!) 
     &lt;bribe him.  tell him he can direct it.&gt; 
     (but he's dead, jim!) 
     &lt;as a director too, but don't worry; people will come just to see 
          if spock lives, bless his little pointy-ears.&gt;

     star... trek... three!!!

     with captain kirk, and mister spock, and 
          doc... mick... coy,   (oh boy!) 
     with scotty, checkov, uh-hoo-rah, and 
          soo... loo... too,  (oh boy!) 
     and saavik's gonna join the crew, but 
          not the one from star trek two, 
     and may... jell... who... is roddenberry's wife.

     it took a while, but paramount has 
          now... turned... face, 
     with indy films, and trek films about 
          ou... ter... space; 
     trek four will make their wallets fat, with 
          trek time-trips and saavik's brat: 
     an an... ni... ver... s'ry gift for all the fans!

before embarking too enthusiastically on this topic, please read the faq.
it may save you the trouble of repeating history.

       heck,  i don't  read documentation: why should i read the faq?

        besides, why should the fact that other people have already done it
stop us from doing it again? why, that's the very basis of our educational
system, and it's so much fun to see those familiar, comfortable flames.

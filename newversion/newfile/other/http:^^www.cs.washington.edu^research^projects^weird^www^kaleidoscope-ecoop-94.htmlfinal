abstract

constraint imperative programming is an integration of declarative constraints
and imperative object-oriented programming.  the primary goal of this
integration is to use constraints to express relations among objects
explicitly -- relations that were implicit in the code in previous languages.
however, one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming,
object identity, can result in implicit relations, even when explicit identity
constraints are supported.  we analyze the problem and propose a solution --
identity constraints -- which we have implemented in our kaleidoscope'93
language.  this solution is understandable, efficiently implementable, and
compatible with the kaleidoscope constraint model.

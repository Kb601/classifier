cse467: advanced logic design
ted kehl, fall 1996 



lab 1

introduction to synario: schematic capture and simulation

distributed:  oct 4 - due: oct 15



objectives
when you have completed this lab, you should know how to:

login to windowsnt and start programs like netscape and synario
create a new project or open an old project in synario
draw schematics for a simple circuit
simulate a combinational circuit in synario by writing a verilog
    driver program
print schematics and programs from synario
  
                              
for this lab, and this lab only, you can choose a lab partner to work
with.  make sure though that you both learn how to use synario - you
should each spend half the time "at the controls".

part 1: logging in

you must have an account on the nt workstations before you can login.
we will let you know what your initial password is.  you must change
this to something only you know the first time you login.  please use
the usual password rules when choosing your password.  also, make sure
you logout out before you leave the lab.

after you login, take a few minutes to look around.  if you have used
windows before, everything should be pretty familiar.  you will be
able to do everything from program manager.  look in the "accessories"
folder for common applications like netscape.  look in the "main"
folder others.  the synario tools we use will be in the "hardware design lab
tools" folder.

the file manager allows you to poke around through the nt directory
structure.  you don't really have to know where everything is, but it
doesn't hurt to get a feel for the lay of the land.  your home
directory will be in the toplevel [z] directory.

part 2: the synario tutorials

the "getting started" tutorials provide an excellent introduction to
synario.  for this lab assignment, you will do tutorials #1 and #2.
 (please read these  noteson the tutorials first.) the
first tutorial walks you around an existing project so you can see how
projects are organized.  (make sure you copy the example project
(prep2) to your own directory before starting this tutorial.)  your
first project will not be this complicated, so don't worry if it
doesn't all make sense.

tutorial #2 leads you through all the steps you will have to follow to
complete the first assignment:  project creation, schematic capture
and simulation.  pay particular attention to how the verilog program
is used to perform the simulation - you will have to write a simple
verilog program to test the circuit you design.

part 3: design a simple circuit

in this part you will design and simulate the following simple
combinational circuit which implements a simple median
filter.  the inputs to this filter are the values (0=black/1=white) of
one pixel and its 4 news neighbors.  the output of the filter circuit
is white if 3 or more of these 5 pixels are white, and black
otherwise.

design a circuit for this filter using a schematic.  you may use any
of the symbols in the generic library.  

hint: this circuit is not that
complicated if you can find a structured way to solve it.

turn in:

schematic of your circuit.
printout of your verilog driver function.
a signed simulation log or waveform which shows that your
circuit works.  you must demo your simulation to one of the tas who
will sign the printout.

the purpose of this page is serve as index to information relevant
to computer architecture researchers.  we plan to point to information
rather than store it locally.  we will include all submissions that
seem appropriate.  thus, inclusion should not be interpreted as an
endorsement of a contribution's accuracy or importance.

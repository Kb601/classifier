     welcome to the online
version of 
cs1000.

this hypertext document provides
an introduction to unix and the instructional computers at the university
of wisconsin.


note!!!!  please don't print these pages.  they contain .gif (picture)
files that take an extremely long time to print.  there is a hard copy
version of cs1000 available at doit for less than $2.50 which is far 
more nicely typeset and has a usable index.

slipping the surly bonds of earth




slipping the surly bonds of earth

bolo's a certified (or is that certifiable) airplane pilot!

i currently hold a commercial pilot's license with
instrument and single engine land ratings.
i was planning on working on a flight instructors certificate
this year, but moving into and taking care of
my new house
has started consuming free time.

normally i fly a piper cherokee, either an
arrow or an archer.
i have been known to pilot a cessna on occasion.

the grumman tiger has always fascinated me.
i'd like to either spend some time flying one, and perhaps
get a "checkout" in it.
if you know of any for rent in the vicinity of madison, wi, usa,
please tell me!

several years ago, i used to own part of an airplane,
a piper cherokee 140.
we spent a lot of time, and 2.5 ratings, together before i
had to sell that wonderful plane.
if you see n5755u, say "hi" for me!

if you were wondering about the title of this page, it's
a reference to a memorable poem, 
high flight,
by john c. magee.

other pilots

some of my friends and colleagues also hold pilot's licenses:

bart miller
john perkins
matt thurmaier
mike litzkow

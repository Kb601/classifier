simplescalar architectural research tool set



what is the simplescalar architectural research tool set?


the simplescalar architectural research tool set comprises compiler,
assembler, linker and simulation tools for the simplescalar architecture.
the tool set is partly derived from the gnu software development tools.
it provides researchers with an easily extensible, portable, high-performance
test bed for systems design.


here are 
slides from the simulation workshop talk i (todd austin) gave at the
last isca in santa margherita ligure, italy.  the talk detailed the tool
set and insights we've gained from its use.



how do i get the simplescalar architectural research tool set?


the source release for version 1.0.0 should be available here in early
1996.  please send me e-mail (at austin@cs.wisc.edu) for further
details.



who made the simplescalar architectural research tool set?


much of the compiler tools are simply ports of the gnu software development
tools to the simplescalar architecture.  the ports as well as the simulators
were written by
todd austin
of the
wisconsin multiscalar group
at the
university of wisconsin - madison.
the development of this code was supported by grants from the national
science foundation (grant ccr-9303030 plus software capitalization
supplement) and the office of naval research (grant n00014-93-1-0465).

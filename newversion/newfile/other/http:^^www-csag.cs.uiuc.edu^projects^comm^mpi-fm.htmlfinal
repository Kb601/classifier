mpi-fm: mpi for fast messages

description

mpi-fm is a high-performance implementation of mpi based on a port of
mpich
to fast messages on the myrinet.
mpi-fm a latency of 25 us and a peak bandwidth of 17.5 mb/s, lower
latency than many commercial mpp's, and respectable bandwidth.  mpi-fm
outperforms the sp2 version of mpich for messages smaller than 1kb 
as shown below.

the performance of mpi-fm shows that mpp-like communication latency
and bandwidth can be achieved with a network of workstations at
the user level with carefully tuned messaging layers.  our thanks
to the mpich creators who produced an mpi implementation which is both
efficient and portable.

performance

the graphs below compare mpi-fm on two
sparcstation 20/71s with supercache to mpich and mpi-f on the ibm sp2.

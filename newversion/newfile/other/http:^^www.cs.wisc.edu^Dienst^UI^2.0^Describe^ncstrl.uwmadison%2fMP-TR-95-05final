 given two finite point sets \sa and \sb in the n-dimensional real space r^n, we consider the np-complete problem of minimizing the number of misclassified points by a plane attempting to divide r^n into two halfspaces such that each open halfspace contains points mostly of \sa or \sb. this problem is equivalent to determining a plane \{ x \mid x^t w= \gamma \} that maximizes the number of points x \in  \sa satisfying x^t w > \gamma, plus the number of points x \in \sb satisfying x^t w . a simple but fast algorithm is proposed that alternates between (i) minimizing the number of misclassified points by translation of the separating plane, and (ii) a rotation of the plane so that it minimizes a weighted average sum of the distances of the misclassified points to the separating plane. existence of a global solution to an underlying hybrid minimization problem is established. computational comparison with a parametric approach to solve the np-complete problem indicates that our approach is considerably faster and appears to generalize better as determined by tenfold cross-validation.

abstract:
this paper addresses a computational biology problem which
is to decide whether two clones (segments of a genome)
overlap based on their  multiple complete digest (mcd) fingerprint.
the problem arises in the context of building a physical map
of a genome, an important step in the human genome project.
the main result is an overlap test which is
argued to be powerful in a stochastic model of the process
in the sense of admitting the lowest false negative rate for a given rate
of false positives.  initial experiments show that it yields about
20% fewer false negatives for a given rate of false positives than
a commonly used test.  this is likely to improve the success of
the subsequent mapping stages.

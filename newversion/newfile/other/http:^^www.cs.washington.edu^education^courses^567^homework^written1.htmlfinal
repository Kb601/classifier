 prove the following simplification theorems using only axioms and
theorems t1-6 and t9-10 from the notes:


a. (a+b)(a+b') = a

b. (a+b)(a'+b) = ab+a'b


 use demorgan's law to complement:

abc+b(c'+d')


 simplify the following using the theorems of boolean algebra:

f(x,y,z) = (x+y)(x'+y+z)(x'+y+z')


 rewrite the following in product of sums form, not necessarily
minimized:

f(a,b,c,d) = ab + cd + ac' + a'd


 implement the logic function f(a,b,c,d,e) =  abcde 
using 2-input nand gates only.  try to minimize worst-case delay.
what is the worst-case delay of your circuit assuming each nand gate
has a delay of 2 ns?


 find a three-variable function that is its own dual.  (this
highlights the fact that duality and complementation are very
different.)

 a 2-bit comparator compares two 2-bit numbers a and b and
generates two results, a>b and a=b.

a. implement a 2-bit comparator.

b. use the 2-bit comparator that you designed in part (a) to construct
at 4-bit comparator.

c. extend the method you used for part (b) to describe how to
implement an n-bit comparator for arbitrary n.  assuming that each
logic gate has a delay of 1 (unit-delay model), what is the delay of
your n-bit comparator as a function of n?

d. (extra credit) if your answer for part (c) was not o(logn) then
find a solution that is.

 consider a three-out-of-five majority gate called m5,  whose
output is 1 if at least three of its five inputs are 1.
a. show how to implement a 2-input and gate using m5 with the inputs
connected appropriately.
b. show how to impement a 3-input or gate using m5.
c. can you use m5 to implement an inverter?

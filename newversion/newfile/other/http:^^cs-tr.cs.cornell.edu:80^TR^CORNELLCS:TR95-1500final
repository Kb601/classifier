 the horus system offers flexible group communication support for distributed applications. it is extensively layered and highly reconfigurable, allowing applications to only pay for services they use, and for groups with different communication needs to coexist in a single system. the approach encourages experimentation with new communication properties and incremental extension of the system, and enables us to support a variety of application-oriented interfaces.

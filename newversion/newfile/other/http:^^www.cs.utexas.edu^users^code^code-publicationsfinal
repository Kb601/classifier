j.c. browne.
international conference on parallel and distributed processing
techniques and applications (pdpta) , 
sunnyvale, california, august 9-11, 1996.
uses code as a target language for compilation, but focuses on extracting parallelism from constraints.

j.c. browne.
 workshop on languages and compilers for parallel computers,
august, 1996, lncs, springer-verlag, to appear.
uses code as a target language for compilation.

ajita john,
j.c. browne.
 1996 international conference on high performance computing,
december, 1996, to appear.
uses code as a target language for compilation.

p. newton.
ieee parallel and distributed technology, spring 1995, volume 3, number 1, 1995.

compares the visual parallel programming environments hence and code 2.



a high level language for specifying graph-based languages and their programming environments,
m. kleyn. dissertation, dept. of computer sciences, univ. of texas at austin, 1995.
this dissertation describes a high-level specification language, glide, for defining integrated graphical/textual programming environments for visual programming languages (those based on directed graph models of computation, like code).


distributed execution environments for the code 2.0 parallel programming system,
rajeev vokkarne. thesis, dept. of computer sciences, univ. of texas at austin, 1995.
thesis describing a distributed implementation of the code runtime system (for pvm).


visual programming and parallel computing,
p. newton.
delivered at workshop on environments and tools for parallel scientific computing, walland, tn, may 26-27, 1994.
short paper on virtues and limitations of hence 2.0 and code 2.0 as well as ramblings on processes as visual components.


visual programming and debugging for parallel computing,
j. c. browne,
s. i. hyder, 
j. dongarra, 
k. moore, 
p. newton. technical report tr94-229, dept. of computer sciences, univ. of texas at austin, 1994.
compares the visual parallel programming environments hence and code 2 (a longer version of the above paper, with more references).


a unified approach to concurrent debugging,
s. i. hyder. dissertation, dept. of computer sciences, univ. of texas at austin, 1994.
dissertation that describes an approach to concurrent debugging that has been implemented for the code 2 environment.


a unified model for concurrent debugging,
s. i. hyder, j. werth, j. c. browne. proceedings of the 1993 international conference on parallel processing, ieee computer society, august 1993.
describes an approach to concurrent debugging that has been implemented for the code 2 environment.


a high level language for specifying graph-based languages and their programming environments, m. kleyn, j.c. browne.  15th international conference on software engineering, baltimore md, april, 1993.
describes a high-level specification language, glide, for defining integrated graphical/textual programming environments for visual programming languages (those based on directed graph models of computation, like code).


a graphical retargetable parallel programming environment and its efficient implementation,
p. newton. technical report tr93-28, dept. of computer sciences, univ. of texas at austin, 1993.
a doctoral dissertation, discussing code 2.0 in depth.


the code 2.0 graphical parallel programming language,
p. newton,
j.c. browne.
proc. acm int. conf. on supercomputing, july, 1992.
this paper describes a prototype implementation of code 2. some of the notations have changed, but the ideas are the same.  this paper remains a good broad introduction to code because it is brief.


a general model for scheduling of parallel computations and its application to parallel i/o operations, r. jain, j. s. werth, and j. c. browne. proceedings of 1991 international conference on parallel processing, august 1991.

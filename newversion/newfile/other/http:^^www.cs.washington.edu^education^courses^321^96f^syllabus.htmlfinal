 text book 
the text for the course is rosen, 
discrete mathematics and its applications.  the  third edition of the 
text will be used.  the second edition is very close but the exercises
differ somewhat between the second and third editions
of the text, so you will need to consult the third edition to make sure
that you are solving the appropriate problems.
the course will probably follow the text
fairly closely.  there are many other discrete mathematics texts
available that cover the same material.  

 grading: the course grade will be based on homework,
a midterm, and a final exam.  the approximate weighting of the three components
is 40-50% homework, 15-25% midterm and 30-40% final exam.

 homework:  homework is intended to be a major portion of the course.
assignments will be due weekly, usually on friday.  it is expected that
homework solutions represent original work.  

 course web:  all the cse 321 handouts will be available on the
department's course web:  document url

http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/321.

the subdirectories contain
copies of handouts from previous offerings of the course
(including old exams).

 purpose:  to provide an introduction to the formal
methods and concepts used in computer science.

 topics: chapters 1-8 will be covered.  the main topics will
be logic (1.1-1.3), methods of proof (3.1-3.3), counting and probability
(4.1-4.5) relations (6.1-6.6),
graph theory (7.1-7.3), and trees (8.1-8.3).

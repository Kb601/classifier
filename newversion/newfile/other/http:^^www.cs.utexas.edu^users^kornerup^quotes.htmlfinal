quotes screaming for formal methods
this is a list of quotes that may convince you that some kind of
formalism is needed in the development of critical software. 

from the arianne 5 crash report, july 1996:
"... the view had been taken that software should be considered correct
until it is shown to be at fault."

the *daily telegraph* 1 oct 1996: "when failure is out of the question"
by paul forster

national air traffic services ltd., part of the civil aviation authority, is
close to completing a new (pounds) 300 million centre at swanick . . .  "it's
all digital and probably the most advanced atc setup anywhere," says dr john
barrett, the swanick project director, almost nonchalantly. "it's so complex
i have difficulty in explaining it even to my board," he says.  throughout,
safety is paramount. the whole system is made up of networked workstations
rather than a central mainframe, so there is no single point of failure. . .
the system totals roughly two million lines of software, but like most
software it is behind schedule and is still being debugged .  . . operations
are not now due to begin until the winter of 1997 . . .  "with atc it's
obvious that we simply have to remove all the faults in the code, and we are
now working 24 hour a day, seven days a week," says barrett. "our
over-arching requirement is that the system has to be completely safe."

september 16 1996 issue of *aviation week & space technology*
(pp. 24-25).
from david a. fulghum's "hard lessons in iraq lead to new attack
plan" in the september 16 1996 issue of *aviation week & space technology*
(pp. 24-25).


the article states: "bomb damage assessment of the initial cruise missile
strike indicates that three of the 10 targets attacked by 13 air force
calcms (conventional air-launched cruise missiles) emerged with "no
detectable damage," according to a u.s. intelligence report.  the boeing
built calcms, converted from cold war-era nuclear weapons at a cost of
$165,000 each, were launched from two b-52h bombers over the persian gulf."

apparently: "part of the problem with the calcms were that they were fired
at targets they were not designed to destroy, a product of hasty planning,
according to a senior pentagon official. air force success rates were
further deflated because of missile computer programming quirks."

further on: "another calcm target escaped damage because of a software
targetting quirk left over from its nuclear role. if two calcms are aimed at
the same target at the same time, one of the missiles will re-aim itself at
the next highest priority target. in the initial raid, one calcm missed the
target while the other went on to the next site."

*electronic engineering times*, 28 oct 1996 "software explosion rattles car makers"

automakers [are facing] runaway growth in the lines of code their engineers
must write and manage as microprocessors take over automotive functions...
``software is where the problem is today,'' said william powers, vp of
research at ford.  ``today, if you change a line of code, you're looking at
the potential for some major problems.  hardware is very predictable, very
repeatable.  software is in much more of a transient state.''  the volume of
code is exploding as processors proliferate behind the dashboard and under
the hood.  the typical auto has 10 to 15 processors; high-end cars can have
as many as 80 ... ``an engine controller can have 100,000 lines of code''
[according to a bosch vp].

program mission

the wisconsin center for space automation and robotics (wcsar) has the 
primary mission of working closely with industry to identify new 
commercial markets, and to develop new products and new technologies to 
successfully address those markets.  the emphasis is on technology 
commercialization, wherein the industry colleagues actively participate 
from the earliest stages of product identification and development.
 
wcsar's main expertise is with advanced closed controlled environment 
systems.  specifically, wcsar and its partners have developed the highly 
successful suite of technologies collectively known as astroculture(tm), 
for the long-term growth and maintenance of plant materials in 
microgravity.  astroculture(tm) hardware has flown on five space shuttle 
missions, the most recent being the second united states microgravity 
laboratory (usml-2) in the fall of 1995.  with the experience gained 
from these missions, the various subsystems of astroculture(tm) have been 
highly refined, to the point where live plants including potatoes, dwarf 
wheat, and mustard, have been flown on orbit successfully.
 
the ultimate goal of this advanced capability is to use the unique 
environment of microgravity to grow plant materials which cannot be 
obtained in normal earth gravity, but which will directly provide new 
commercial products, or will help to develop new products through 
enhanced research.  these products or product enhancements include 
genetically engineered advanced crop materials, unique methods of 
long-term storage and preservation of plant materials, and natural plant 
products with pharmaceutical applications.  also available for 
commercialization are the individual subsystems from astroculture(tm), 
including environmental control for large-scale commercial plant growing 
facilities and a device to remove atmospheric hydrocarbons from enclosed 
areas. 
 

facilities

wcsar occupies a suite of offices and laboratories in the main building 
of the college of engineering.  this includes a modern cad design 
studio, a complete electronics shop and small machining area for 
fabrication of prototypes, and several laboratory plant growth chambers.  
additional facilities for specific collaborative programs typically are 
available through campus and industry colleagues.
 

program administration

wcsar is a program of the college of engineering, university of 
wisconsin-madison.  a management advisory board comprised of leaders 
from the agricultural industry and from the financial sector provide 
valuable input to wcsar's director, who works with industry colleagues 
to set the goals for the program.  a fulltime staff of scientists and 
engineers supply technical strength to the program.

fiction
this page contains random comments on various things i have read, generally
fiction, although there may be some non-fiction thrown in at some point, or
at least references to it.  there are also references to other media, such
as 

games
, and video sources, such as movies or television shows.
perhaps written, in the spirit of
rec.arts.sf.written is more appropriate, but it didn't sound right
either.  basically, this page covers books i have read and found
interesting for one reason or another. they are organized in no
particular order. 
you can also find out

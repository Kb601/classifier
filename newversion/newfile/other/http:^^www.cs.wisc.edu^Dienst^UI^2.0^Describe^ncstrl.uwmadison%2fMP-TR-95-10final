 this paper describes a suite of programs that allow realistic complementarity problems to be accessed from within the matlab programming environment. the suite of programs uses data generated from the gams/mcp library and makes function and jacobian evaluations available directly to the matlab user. all the required data is stored in a binary encoding of the problems, completely independent of gams. use of the programs is described here, along with a list of all the problems that are currently available in binary form. details on how the binary files are generated from gams are also given.

we will use the technique given in the handout and explained by jim
fix to construct a regular grammar for .
since we eventually need to generate a unique set of non-terminals for 
each a and b in the regular expression, we annotate the expression
with indices: .  these indices aren't
intended to mean anything, but we'll use them for bookeeping as we develop the grammar.  for each set of productions, we denote any starting symbol
s as .  if any nonterminal and its productions can be 
eliminated because it is unreachable from the starting symbol, it is 
marked with .







thus the final grammar constructed is:




.

.
each production is used once.


.


with start symbol  the grammar is:



the meaning of  is that the number of a's generated by  is
equal to .

 
the fact we are trying to prove is that if  has
an equal number of a's as b's then .  this
will be proved by induction on n where |x| = 2n.

the basis is n=0.  the only string of length 0 is . 
 in one step.

the inductive hypothesis is: if w is a string in  with an equal
number of a's as b's and |w| &lt; 2n, then .

case 1 of the induction step.  recall that we are assuming that
x has an equal number of a's as b's, |x| = 2n and n &gt; 0.
in case 1 there is a string y such that x =yz, y has
an equal number of a's as b's, , and .

since both x and  y have an equal number of a's as b's then
it must be the case that z does also.
since  then |y| &lt; 2n.  since  then it
must be the case that |z| &lt; 2n.  thus, both y and z satisfy the
hypothesis of the inductive hypothesis. 
hence,  and .  by using the
first production with these two derivations we have the derivation.

abstract
there is a growing need for parallel programming software
tools that make writing parallel programs easier. the goal is to
provide transparent communication in a message passing
multiprocessor environment. we have implemented a software package
using c++ that meets this need. in this paper we describe the design
and implementation of global pointers over c++ and active
messages. in addition, several issues concerning implementation and
solutions are discussed. a performance summary and a few
examples of the use of our system are included.

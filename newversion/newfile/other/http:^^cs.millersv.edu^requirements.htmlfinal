you can find the 
course descriptions


for each computer science course.





 the core requirements:

the objective of the core requirements is to provide you with the skills that are considered to be fundamental to a sound background in computer science.  this includes grounding in various aspects of programming, computer organization, and the legal and ethical issues that are affected by computer applications.  in addition, a thorough background in mathematics and computer science theory provide a strong analytic component, as well as providing many useful concepts of interest to computer programmers.

  csci 151 - discrete structures i
  3 s.h.


  csci 161 - introduction to computing i  
  4 s.h.


  csci 162 - introduction to computing ii 
  4 s.h.


  csci 226 - computer organization i

additional requirments

every computer science major is required to complete engl 312 technical writing. 

students who intend to pursue graduate study in computer science may complete a total of 15 s.h. of additional advanced csci electives ("systems" and "applied" courses) and advanced math courses (200-400 level) approved by the academic advisor combined with a maximum of 6 s.h. chosen from the courses below.




  csci 200 - cooperative education	  
   3 s.h. 


  csci 300 - cooperative education	  
   3 s.h. 







requirements for b.s. degree


there are two components of the b.s. degree in computer science.  the first is the core, which all computer science majors must take.  the second is an elective section, in which each major selects four courses, based on personal interest and career goals, from among advanced topics in computer science.  this allows students to tailor their course work to their own needs, while ensuring that every student receives the same fundamental background in certain important areas of computer science.

before being admitted to the next computer science or mathematics course in a sequence, a grade of "c" or better must be earned in every prerequisite course.

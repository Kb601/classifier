doctoral dissertation 

  finally!!  , as promised, an electronic version of my recent doctoral dissertation, titled: 


an empirical comparison of copresent and technologically-mediated interaction based on communicative breakdown  



(and for all of you that have contacted me for a copy, thanks for your patience...)


first, click here to read just the abstract.


then, if you're sufficiently interested, you can 
download a binhexed word for macintosh
version of the complete dissertation.

or you can download a postscript 
version (2mb). note that postscript has sometimes been a problematic format
 for me; let me know if you have any trouble with it.

another easy way to get a copy of the dissertation is to request it from the university of oregon 
computer science department; the dissertation is available (free of charge) as technical report cis-tr-96-01.
just click here to send a mail message
 to ms. jan saunders, who is responsible for distributing tech. reports, and
ask for report number cis-tr-96-01.


a short summary! if you want a good overview of the dissertation results, but don't have the stomach for reading the whole thing, you may be interested in the draft 
of a paper derived from the dissertation work: 
as a postscript file .

again, please contact me if you have
any difficulties downloading any of these files.

what is cold soldered?  it's not 
hot wired...  it is an expanse of web pages
showcasing the projects of the upl in code, music, and art. at the
undergraduate projects lab - the social hub of the uw-madison computer science
department - we provide an environment for undergraduates
to work on programming projects of their own devising.
the pages here cannot do justice
to the cornucopia of projects that are perpetually hatched out in the upl,
but serve as an attempt to showcase some of the more refined works that
have been developed here.


this page is perpetually updated.  please bother us if your experience of our
pages includes running across links to nowhere; eternal vigilance is the
only solution.

note: cold soldered is netscape enhanced, which means that most of our pages 
contain netscape extensions.  for those of you with netscape incompatible 
browsers, we've endeavored to build compatible and aesthetic pages. these 
pages are text-browser compatible.

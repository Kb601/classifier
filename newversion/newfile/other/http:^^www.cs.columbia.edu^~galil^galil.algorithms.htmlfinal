 algorithms

i am working on designing new sequential and parallel algorithms, and
improving existing ones, to solve various computational problems such
as:  graph isomorphism, membership in permutation groups (generalized
rubik's cube), network flow, matching in graphs, boolean
matrix multiplication, and connectivity of graphs.

recently, i have been concentrating on the following problems.

dynamic graph algorithms. these are algorithms which solve problems in
which the input graph keeps 
changing; e.g.  edges are inserted and deleted or weights are
increased or decreased.  the goal is to maintain the solution in such
a way that the changes in it can be found faster than resolving the
problem from scratch.

string processing algorithms with applications to molecular biology.
there exist computational problems associated with the human
genome project where algorithmic improvements are possible. an area
were considerable progress has already been achieved is the speed up
of various dynamic programming techniques.

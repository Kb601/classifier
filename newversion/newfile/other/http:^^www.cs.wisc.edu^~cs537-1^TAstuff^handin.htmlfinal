hand-in for project 2


hand-in procedure

the procedure for handing in project 2 (and the rest of the projects
this semester) will be a little different than for project 1.
you should follow the guidelines below:

bring a hard copy of all your .java
files to class on the day the program
is due (if you do not want to lose late days). 
submit an electronic version of all you files
(.java, makefile, output files, etc.) to the hand-in directory
of either you or your partner.  your hand-in directory
for project 2 is in: ~cs537-1/public/handin/project2.
if you are programming at home using the windows
95 version of java, you will still need to hand in your code
on-line (and you should make sure it works in the solaris environment
- which will entail adding the threadscheduler code).  
add a readme file to your electronic
hand-in directory that contains the following:

name of you and your partner.
project information (project number, date, etc.).
information on how to run your program.
a brief map of the classes you have written and what they
do.
any other information you feel is important for the ta to
know.



output files

 you should not hand in a hard copy of your output (it
will use too much paper).  instead you should run the tests required
by the assignment and output the results to a file.  i would prefer
if you could create separate files for each test (e.g.: alg1peterson.test,
alg2peterson.test, alg1star.test, alg2star.test.) instead
of having everything bunched together into a single typescript
file.  you can do this by redirecting the output.  the format
of the output is described in the assignment.
comments

 comments are going to be worth at least 10% of the grade
for this assignment.  so if you do not want to lose any of the
points, you should follow the guidelines below:

you should write your name and your partner's name, the assignment
number, and the hand-in date at the top of all your .java files
as well as give a brief description of what the file contains.
you should comment your variables so we know how they are
used.
functions should be commented as to their purpose, what variables
are being passed in, what value is being returned (if any), as
well as any side effects.
you should document segments of code and provide the purpose
of each.  particularly difficult segments of code will require
more commenting.

program structure

 program structure will also be worth at least 10%.  some
guidelines follow:

your code should be correctly indented.
you code should have blank lines separating different segments
of code.
variable names should have meaning.
curly brackets should be correctly lined-up.

abstract:
the trains  project is an effort to build a conversationally
  proficient planning assistant. a key part of the project is the
  construction of the trains  system, which provides the research
  platform for a wide range of issues in natural language
  understanding, mixed-initiative planning systems, and representing
  and reasoning about time, actions and events.  four years have now
  passed since the beginning of the project. each year we have
  produced a demonstration system that focused on a dialog that
  illustrates particular aspects of our research.  the commitment to
  building complete integrated systems is a significant overhead on
  the research, but we feel it is essential to guarantee that the
  results constitute real progress in the field. this paper describes
  the goals of the project, and our experience with the effort so far.

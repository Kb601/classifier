 qpcomp is an extremely robust algorithm for solving mixed nonlinear complementarity problems that has fast local convergence behavior. based in part on the ne/sqp method of pang & gabriel (1993), this algorithm represents a significant advance in robustness at no cost in efficiency. in particular, the algorithm is shown to solve any solvable lipschitz continuous, continuously differentiable, pseudo-monotone mixed nonlinear complementarity problem. qpcomp also extends the ne/sqp method for the nonlinear complementarity problem to the more general mixed nonlinear complementarity problem. computational results are provided, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

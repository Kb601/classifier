of measurement, or combinations of units.  it can also simplify
expressions of units.

a number such as 2.5, a product of two or more unit expressions
(* expr1 ... exprn),
or a quotient of two unit expressions (/ expr1 expr2).
common abbreviations such as ft are allowed.

an example is (/ (* atto parsec) (* micro fortnight)).

when the program is started, a window is created containing a command menu
and input and output areas.  click the appropriate menu items to run
the demo.

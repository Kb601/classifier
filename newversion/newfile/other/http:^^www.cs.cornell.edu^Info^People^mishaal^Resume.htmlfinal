projects/research:
march 1993
interactive qualifying project:  virtual reality in education
a study of the possible application of virtual reality as an aid to students.  an examination of practical and theoretical applications was presented.  built a pc-based virtual reality unit as a demonstration to students.			 (part of a two member team)
grade received: a.
may 1994
major qualifying project (electrical engineering):  micromouse iii: the theseus project
design and implement a sensor system for an autonomous robot designed to solve a maze in competition.  the system was based on infra-red detectors and shaft-encoders to determine the position of the robot.  the design had to be small yet efficient enough to be reliable.  since the project was made up of six students,  this was a very useful opportunity to  learn how to cooperate in a group and was an aid to understanding intercommunication in a project. (part of a six member team)
grade received: b.
may 1995
major qualifying project (computer science): micromouse iii: the theseus project
	a continuation of the above project.  continue to integrate the different parts of the project by redesigning the software that was developed in assembly and c.  extensive testing and debugging of the robot was required to achieve a competitive micromouse.
grade received: a.
fall 1995
masters of engineering research: optimal video transmission
this project will improve upon an  existing prioritization algorithm for bandwidth-constrained video transmission.  the object is to determine which frames of a video sequence to drop so as to optimize perceptual continuity of the received sequence.  the algorithm will be modified to take the rate of motion into account when prioritizing frames for transmission, so that frames with more motion are less likely to be dropped.  the results would probably be published to complement the paper already published discussing the optimal frame prioritization.  an extension to an existing contenious media playback system will also be implemented.
still ongoing.

skills/work experience:
summer 1993		
aerated concrete industries

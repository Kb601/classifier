i am currently in my fifth year of a doctoral program in educational
psychology.  my current research involves human motivation and the way
that peoples' conceptions of the future affect their motivation.  i have
a wonderful talent for getting in over my head and getting it all
done. ;-) (i must know i have some limitations.  i decided that i would
not attempt to learn how to make a home page from the beginning two days
before this was due, during the worst part of the semester.)

the topics which i find interesting.... unfortunately most everything is
interesting to me.  i am particularly enthralled with: language acquisition
(first and second), evolution of language, causal reasoning, and the
philosophy that underlies cognitive science.

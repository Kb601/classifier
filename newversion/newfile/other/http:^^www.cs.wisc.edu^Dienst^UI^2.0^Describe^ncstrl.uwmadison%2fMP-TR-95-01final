 optimization has played a significant role in training neural networks. this has resulted in a number of efficient algorithms and practical applications in medical diagnosis and prognosis. other applications of neural networks abound. in this brief work we focus on a number of problems of machine learning and pose them as optimization problems. hopefully this will point to further applications of optimization to the burgeoning field of machine learning.

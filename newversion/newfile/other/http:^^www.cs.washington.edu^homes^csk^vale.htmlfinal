valedictorian's address


madam chancellor, members of convocation, ladies and gentlemen,
fellow graduates:

an incredible journey which we undertook years ago is finally coming
to an end.  we're at that point on the roller coaster where the ride is
over, and you're sliding into the station.  it's time to relax your death
grip on the safety bar, attempt to regain your composure, and celebrate.
it's time to contemplate the magnitude of the achievement that allows us
to call ourselves the class of 1996.  for somehow, after tremendous
investments of time and money, after sleepless nights, after noble
brain cells that gave their lives in the line of duty, we have converged
here, today, to be honoured and recognized for what we have become.
in the next few minutes, i would like to describe my view of the journey
we've taken, and point out all those who helped along the way.


                             *  *  *


most of us came to waterloo because of an appreciation of, or perhaps
an infatuation with mathematics.  others, who grew up with the commodore 
64 or the apple ii, came because computers were endlessly fascinating.
although i adored my 64, i came to waterloo for the mathematics.  for
me, math has always been like a toy that's constantly new.  every day it
feels like you're ripping off the wrapping paper for the first time.
and there's math, like the world's largest lego set.  infinitely subtle,
infinitely varied, just pick a direction, and follow it as far as your
imagination will take you.  that direction led to waterloo.

after a short while at waterloo, immersed in mathematics like never 
before, i came to a startling realization.  math was magic.  a jargon
i could not understand was used to summon these remarkable creatures 
called 'theorems'.  theorems came in all shapes and sizes, too.  lesser 
theorems were known as 'propositions'.  some theorems kept familiars called 
'lemmas'.  and this magic could not be harnessed by the likes of me. 
i was far too clumsy and naive. but i longed to understand and control mathematics.  
i knew that if i looked hard enough, i would see right through the magic to 
the ordered structure underneath.  and thus i became determined to uncover the 
process through which mathematics becomes magic.

that period of awe marked the beginning of the long journey that has
brought us all here.  much has happened along the way, events and 
experiences which shaped us and infused us with the spirit of math at
waterloo.  personally,  i developed a love for computer science, and a 
predilection for card games.  i deleveoped a soft spot for self-reference
and a taste for institutional food.  we've all absorbed the majority of
the greek alphabet by osmosis.  it was only in my last term here that i
finally learned how to write a zeta!  many of us learned that the air 
conditioners in the computer labs shut down at 11:00pm.  some of us also 
learned that they reactivate at 6:30am.  there were parties, some wild, 
some not so wild.  there was oktoberfest and canada day, the bombshelter 
and fed hall.  and the comfy lounge.  and work terms!  and thirteen moving 
days!  and even, occasionally, lectures!  and, finally, this!


                             *  *  *


it goes without saying that none of us could have done it alone.  each 
of us relied on the guidance and support of many others to make it this 
far.  those people should be recognized for their contributions towards
our achievement.  

the group that held the most explicit power over our destinies is 
certainly the faculty.  fortunately for us, our faculty is outstanding.
oh, sure, some profs will make life difficult for you, but i consider
that to be the exception, and it's only for four months, right?  when
i think of the professors i've had, i think of people who bent over
backwards for us, who made every possible allowance to see us come
through intact.  i think of people who went way beyond the call of duty
to bring us the education that we wanted to have.  without their support,
we couldn't have made it.

the co-op students among us will certainly recognize the importance our 
employers have had in our undergraduate careers.  work terms provided a context
for knowledge acquired in lectures, and helped to solidify that knowledge
in preparation for coming school terms.  work terms also provided much
needed funds, and an endless supply of t-shirts.

the ones most responsible for our well being, on the other hand, were 
our friends and fellow students.  they're the ones who made the daily
grind of university life tolerable.  right from my first day at waterloo, i 
have formed friendships that i can only hope will last a lifetime.  you have all 
been so wonderful.  and with all the incredible talent and achievement
in the class of 1996, i'm proud to call so many of you friends.

finally, and maybe most importantly of all, we cannot forget our families.
whether near or far geographically, their fundamental influence on our lives 
will always be felt.  thank you to all the families who came today to
bear witness to our accomplishments.  my own family is here today from montreal.
they were always supportive of me throughout my time here.  yes, i can still
recall my father's gentle words of encouragement: "no ambition!  you're only
going to do a double major in pure math and cs?  that's what everybody's doing
these days!"

seriously though, if there's one thing that has led me to success more than 
anything else, it is what i have learned from my parents.  they taught me that 
i should follow my pursuits with tenacity, and with the thrill of the chase.  
they taught me that every avenue left unexplored is an opportunity lost 
forever.  they taught me that with a little determination, i can do anything
and be anyone i want.


                             *  *  *


now that the journey is almost over, you may wonder what became of my mission.
did i manage to locate the order and structure beneath the magical outer layer
of mathematics?  well, after five years of careful observation, i am pleased
to report that mathematics is still total magic.  underneath all the jargon,
all the neat covering of tracks, all the perceived magic, there lurks the 
real magic, the true soul of mathematics, forever only visible in the 
minutest of cross sections.  math is difficult.  it takes patience to do it right. 
but when you're tackling that hard problem, and inspiration hits, and all the 
pieces fall into place, huzzah!  that's the kind of magic i'm talking about, and 
that's what makes it all worthwhile.

this journey is over.  now the fun part, the future, begins.  class of 1996,
shared a great deal.  but remember one thing, my friends.  the single most
important thing we shared is the spirit of mathematics at waterloo.  and 
wherever your future may lead, remember to always take that spirit with you.

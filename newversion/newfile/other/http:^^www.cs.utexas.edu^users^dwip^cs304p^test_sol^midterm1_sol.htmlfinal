solutions for problems in midterm i 


------------------------------------problem #1---------------------------------------------

only a single pascal statement is required, although the computation could be done with a 
couple of statements instead. 

program problem1;
var
 s1, s2, s3 : string;
begin
  writeln('enter s1, the substring');
  readln(s1);
  writeln('enter s2, the superstring');
  readln(s2);
  s3:=copy(s2, pos(s1,s2), length(s2) - pos(s1,s2) + 1);  { 


------------------------------------problem #2---------------------------------------------

the procedure is all that is needed. 

program problem2;
var
  s : string;
  n : integer;

procedure vowelcount (var s: string; var numberofvowels: integer);
var
  i : integer;
  chr : string;
begin
  numberofvowels := 0;
  i :=i 1;
  while i 


------------------------------------problem #3---------------------------------------------

the procedure is all that is needed. 

program problem3;
type
 integerarray = array [1..100] of integer;
var
 a : integerarray;
 n, i : integer;

procedure fib(var fibarray: integerarray; var n: integer);
var
 i : integer;
begin
 i := 3;
 fibarray[1] := 1;  { don't worry that n might be less than 2 }
 fibarray[2] := 1;
 while i 


------------------------------------problem #4---------------------------------------------

no, not every pascal program is an algorithm. all pascal program meet the first few
requirements because, to a pascal machine, pascal operations are well ordered, unambiguous, and 
effectively computable. however, not all pascal programs meet the last constraint. that is,
some pascal programs fail to halt in finite time because they contain an infinite loop,
such as the following program: 

program infiniteloop;
var i : integer;
begin
  i := 1;
  while i = 1 do writeln('i am looping ... ');
end.




------------------------------------problem #5---------------------------------------------

since we have dealt with array in class, we'll use four arrays to store our information: 

title : stringarray
artist : stringarray
recording_studio : stringarray
no_in_stock : integerarray

we also need a variable to keep track of the number of unique cds in the inventory (to know when
to stop the loop. 
to print out report a procedure called print is used.
parameters: title, artist, recording_studio :stringarray, no_in_stock: integerarray, index:integer
function: given an index (location), it prints out the contents of all four arrays at that index.

to search, we define a procedure search.
parameters: item_searched: string; array_searched: stringarray; position : integer;
function: it goes through the array_searched and gets the position where it finds a match with
item_searched. it then calls print to output a report and does this for the entire array.

by calling search with different parameters (say title_of_cd, and the array title etc.) we can
perform all the three searches required in this case.
------------------------------------problem #6---------------------------------------------

a database machine can be built "on top of" a pascal machine by writing a pascal program that
runs on the pascal nachine and implements the operations of the database machine. these
operations might include : add-record, delete-record, search-for-record, and so on.


------------------------------------problem #7---------------------------------------------


program problem7;
type
  realarray = array [1..100] of real;
var
  arr : realarray;
  n: integer;
  sum, avg : real;
begin
  readarray(arr, n);
  sumarray(arr, n, sum);
  avg := sum / n ;
  writeln('average is: ',avg);
  printarray(a, n);
end.



------------------------------------problem #8---------------------------------------------


program problem8;
type
  integerarray = array [1..100] of integer;
var
  arr : integerarray;
  n: integer;
begin
 {initialize the array to zeros}
 n := 1;
 while n  -1 do
 begin
   a[n] := a[n] + 1;
   writeln('enter an integer between 1 and 100, or -1 to stop');
   readln(n);
 end;
 {write out the frequency of integers that occurred more than once}
 n := 1;
 while n  1 then
      writeln(n, ' occurred ', a[n], ' times.');
   n := n + 1;
 end;
 readln;
end.


   

------------------------------------problem #9---------------------------------------------

a procedure's formal parameters may have different names than the actual parameters used in a call
to the procedure. this is important for making the procedure modular and enabling its reuse. a
program may use a procedure without knowing the names of the variables that the procedure uses. also,
the procedure may be used by many programs, each of which calls the procedure with different 
actual parameters.

part b. 
it is conceivable that a grammar checker could be written using such rules. the grammar checker
would attempt to generate each sentence written with the word processor. those sentences that
can be generated using the rules would be deemed to be correct. those sentences that could not
be generated with the rules would be deemed incorrect. 
however, the set of rules would be very large. a complete set of rules for english has not been
developed.

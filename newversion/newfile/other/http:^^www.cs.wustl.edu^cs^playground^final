     the programmers' playground
     playground is a
     programming model and
     a set of  software tools 
     to support end-user construction of distributed multimedia applications
     from modular software building blocks.
     features include a separation of communication from computation,
     dynamic reconfiguration, and uniform treatment of discrete and
     continuous data types.  this
     color poster summarizes some of
     playground's features.
  






  
  
      programming model 
     playground is based on  i/o abstraction, 
     a programming model in which each module of a distributed
     system interacts with an external environment through a narrow
     data interface.  the model supports a separation of active and reactive
     control and inherits ideas from the formal i/o automaton
     model.
  






  
  
     software tools
      playground provides
     sofware tools to support
     development of playground modules in c++, end-user graphical
     configuration of those modules into distributed applications,
     and end-user construction of
     constraint-based direct-manipulation
     graphical user interfaces for those distributed applications.
  






  
  
     can i play? 
     yes! try these cool demos, or you can
     become a playground user and create
     your own distributed applications.
  






  
  
      courses 
     an undergraduate lab course 
     in distributed applications
     was offered recently using the playground software.  the materials
     are available for course adoption.
  






  
  
      publications 
     these papers describe the programming model and
     software tools in more detail.
  






  
  
      people 
     meet the distributed programming environments group.
  






  
  
       funding 
     research and development for the programmers' playground has been
     supported by washington university and
     these sponsors.

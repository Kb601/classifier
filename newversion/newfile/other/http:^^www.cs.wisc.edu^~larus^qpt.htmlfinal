 qpt:  a quick program profiling and tracing system 


qpt is an exact and efficient program profiler and tracing system.  it
rewrites a program's executable file (a.out) by inserting code to
record the execution frequency or sequence of every basic block
(straight-line sequence of instructions) or control-flow edge.  from
this information, another program qpt_stats can calculate the
execution cost of procedures in the program.  unlike the unix tools
prof and gprof, qpt records exact execution frequency, not a
statistical sample.  when tracing a program, qpt produces a trace
regeneration program that reads the highly compressed trace file and
regenerates a full program trace.


when profiling, qpt operates in two modes.  in "slow" mode, it places
a counter in each basic block in a program--in the same manner as the
mips tool pixie.  in "quick" mode, qpt places counters on an
infrequently-executed subset of the edges in the program's
control-flow graph.  this placement can reduce the cost of profiling
by 3--4 times.  since there is no such thing as a free lunch, quick
profiling requires more program analysis and consequently slows qpt
and qpt_stats.  the additional cost to instrument a program and report
results, however, is small and is quickly gained back when profiling
long-running programs.


like other systems such as pixie, qpt can rewrite an executable file to
record the sequence of instruction and data references.  however, qpt uses
abstract execution to reduces the overhead of tracing to 2--6 times a
program's untraced execution cost.  qpt also records a number of semantics
events--such as loop entry and iteration, function entry and exit, and
memory allocation and deallocation--that other systems do not identify.



the original version of this program, qpt, is obsolete and has not been
maintained for several years.  at that time, it ran under dec's ultrix on a
decstation (mips processor) and sun's sunos 4.1.2 on a sparcstation.


qpt2, the new version of qpt, is build on

eel,

a library for editing executable files.  eel currently runs on sparc-based
machines (sunos and solaris), though other ports in progress.  the
machine-specific code in eel and qpt2 is collected in a few files.  porting
to a new machine requires a couple months of effort.

 applications 

david wood has develop a cache profiler called cprof that uses traces
from qpt to report the cache misses caused by statements in a program.
cprof is available as part of warts.

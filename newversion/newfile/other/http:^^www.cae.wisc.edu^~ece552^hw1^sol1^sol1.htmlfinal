  question 2.1 cost effectiveness is performance per dollar of cost,
and the performance will depend on the workload choice.

cost effectiveness can be measured in the numbers of executions per second
per dollar of machine cost:

executions per second per dollar =   

executions per second per dollar for s1  =  

executions per second per dollar for s2 dollars =  

so system 2 is more cost effective.  by a ratio of  



 question 2.2 we can use the same method as the previous part, but
the execution time is the sum of the two execution times.

executions per second per dollar for s1 =  

executions per second per dollar for s2 =  

so system 1 is slightly more cost effective, by a factor of
 



 question 2.3 we do this problem by finding the amount of time that
program 2 can be run in an hour and using that for executions per second,
the throughput measure.

executions of p2 per hour = 


executions of p2 per hour on s1 = 


executions of p2 per hour on s2 = 


hence we can conclude that s2 has higher throughput. 

cost per run per hour for p2 in dollars: 

for s1 =   = 18.76 

for s2 =   = 23.07 

hence s1 is more cost effective for this workload.  
 


 question 2.27

 

harmonic mean (hm) =  

mean of times = 

mean of times = 

therefore, hm =

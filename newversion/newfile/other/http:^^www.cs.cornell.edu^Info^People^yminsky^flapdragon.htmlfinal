  coop flapdragon:  
  house of squiddle 


"locking you out since 1995."


 an opening in flapdragon! 

there is an opening starting 12/15 at flapdragon!  if you'd like to
find out more, call 273-1645 and ask for kerrin or any of the other
denizens.




 flapdragon quote of the indeterminate time period  
(in honor of the election...)

 "zab wouldn't mind eating bob dole."	

                 -ravitte, referring to the fact that zab 
                  is neither vegetarian nor republican.






 flapdragon is now in its second year, and going strong, with an all new
set of members.  i (who no longer live in flap but still handle the
homepage) still haven't gotten around to updating the webpage, but i will get
the new member list and the new quote list up in the next week or so.  and
somebody's got to take some new pictures....

 some basic information:  we're located at 331 w. seneca, ithaca
ny, 14850, and our phone number is (607) 273-1645.  click 
 here 
for definitions of squiddle and flapdragon.

take a look at the, ahem, somewhat edited, and newly extended
flapdragon quote list.

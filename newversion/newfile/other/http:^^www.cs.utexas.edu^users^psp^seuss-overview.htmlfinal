overview of seuss


we are currently working on a project, called seuss.  the
research proposed in seuss is based on two observations: (1) the
applications that will be implemented on networks of processors in the
future will be significantly more ambitious than the current
applications (which are mostly involved with transmissions of digital
data and images), and (2) many of the programming concepts developed
for databases, object-oriented programming and designs of reactive
systems can be unified into a concise model of distributed programs
that can serve as the foundation for designing these future
applications.

research in multiprogramming has, traditionally, attempted to
reconcile two apparently contradictory goals: (1) it should be
possible to understand a module (e.g., a process or a data object) in
isolation, without considerations of interference by the other
modules, and (2) it should be possible to implement concurrent threads
at a fine level of granularity so that no process is ever locked out
of accessing common data for long periods of time. the goals are
in conflict because fine granularity, in general, implies
considerable interference. the earliest multiprograms (see, for
instance, the solution to the mutual exclusion problem in dijkstra
[0])
were trivially small and impossibly difficult to
understand, because the behaviors of the individual processes could
not be understood in isolation, and all possible interactions among
the processes had to be analyzed explicitly.  since then, much effort
has gone into limiting or even eliminating interference among
processes by employing a variety of synchronization mechanisms: locks
or semaphores, critical regions, monitors and message communications.

constraining the programming model to a specific protocol (binary
semaphores or message communication over bounded channels, for
instance) will prove to be short-sighted in designing complex
applications. more general mechanisms for interactions among modules,
that include these specific protocols, are required. further, for the
distributed applications of the future, it is essential to devise a
model in which the distinction between computation and communication
is removed; in particular, the methods for designing and reasoning
about the interfaces should be no different from those employed for
the computations at the nodes of the network.

seuss fosters a discipline of programming that makes it
possible to understand a program execution as a single thread of
control, yet it permits program implementation through multiple
threads. as a consequence, it is possible to reason about the
properties of a program from its single execution thread, whereas an
implementation on a specific platform (e.g., shared memory or message
communicating system) may exploit the inherent concurrency
appropriately. a central theorem establishes that multiple execution
threads implement single execution threads, i.e., any property proven
for the latter is a property of the former as well.

a major point of departure in seuss is that there is no built-in
concurrency and no commitment to either shared memory or
message-passing style of implementation. no specific communication or
synchronization mechanism, except the procedure call, is built into the
model. in particular, the notions of input/output and their
complementary nature in rendezvous-based communication
([1] , [2])
are outside this model. there is no distinction between computation and
communication; process specifications and interface specifications are
not distinguished. consequently, we do not have many of the
traditional multiprogramming concepts such as, processes, locking,
rendezvous, waiting, interference and deadlock, as basic concepts in
our model. yet, typical multiprograms employing message passing over
bounded or unbounded channels can be encoded in seuss by declaring the
processes and channels as the components of a program; similarly,
shared memory multiprograms can be encoded by having processes and
memories as components. seuss permits a mixture of either style of
programming, and a variety of different interaction mechanisms --
semaphore, critical region, 4-phase handshake, etc. -- can be encoded
as components.

seuss proposes a complete disentanglement of the sequential and
concurrent aspects of programming.  we expect large sections of code
to be written, understood and reasoned-about as sequential
programs. we view multiprogramming as a way to orchestrate the
executions of these sequential programs, by specifying the conditions
under which each program is to be executed. typically, several
sequential programs will execute simultaneously; yet, we can guarantee
that their executions are non-interfering, and hence, each program may
be regarded as atomic. we propose an efficient implementation scheme
that can, using user directives, interleave the individual sequential
programs with fine granularity without causing any interference.

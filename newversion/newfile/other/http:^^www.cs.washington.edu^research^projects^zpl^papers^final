implementation of zpl.




benchmark performance evaluation papers






zpl vs. hpf: a comparison of performance and programming style (may, 1995)
compares zpl and hpf using a set of nas, nasa and genesis benchmark 
programs.

performance comparisons against hand-coded programs.




real-world applications of zpl

 describes how zpl is used to solve n-body solver.



the portable parallel implementation of two novel mathematical biology
algorithms in zpl (july, 1995)
 describes how zpl is used to solve two mathematical biology problems.






 foundations of zpl
 machine model papers 







type architecture, shared memory and the corollary of modest potential (1986)
 discusses the need for accurate abstract machine models when
     developing efficient algorithms.  introduces the cta abstract machine
     model.






programming models -- shared- vs. nonshared-memory models





a comparison of programming models for shared memory multiprocessors (1990)
 
empirical comparison of how the shared memory and non-shared memory
programming models effect the performance of programs on shared memory
multiprocessors.



a comparison of shared and nonshared memory models of parallel computation (1991)
 
theoretical comparison of the shared memory and non-shared memory
programming models and their influence on parallel algorithm performance.



on the influence of programming models on shared memory computer performance (1992)
 
experimental comparsion of shared memory and non-shared memory programming
models for three machines and two applications (lu decomposition and water).






programming models -- abstractions and a-zpl (formerly orca c)






scalable abstractions for parallel programming (1990)
 
introduces the notion of ensembles that provides scalability.



a flexible communication abstraction for nonshared memory parallel computing
 (november, 1990)
 
introduces the notion of port ensembles that separates the 
specification of communication from computation.



abstractions for portable, scalable parallel programming (december, 1993)
 
extensive discussion of the phase abstractions programming model.



foundations of practical parallel programming languages  (1993)
 
describes the relation between zpl and orca c, and describes the underlying
models for these languages.

miscellany






accommodating polymorphic data decompositions in explicitly parallel
programs (april, 1994)
 why message passing libraries alone are not sufficient for portability.

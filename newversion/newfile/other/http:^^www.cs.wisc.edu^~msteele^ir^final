where did i get these pictures from?
maryland's computer
vision research group (specifically 
ross cutler) needed test subjects for a
project involving infrared images.  so, they asked for volunteers, 
promising a copy of our photos when they were done.  
being the sucker for cool stuff like this that i am, i signed up and
got my picture taken.

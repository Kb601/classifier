ai at the univ. of wisconsin - madison 






 ai research and education in the computer sciences department 

this is the world wide web home page for the ai group in the 

university of wisconsin computer sciences department.


we are studying computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and
automated deduction. themes in 
 computer vision and 
 robotics
include active approaches for
controlling camera position and orientation in order to solve tasks such as
navigation, scene exploration, and surface reconstruction.  
 machine learning
research focuses on the integration of symbolic and connectionist (neural
network) approaches to ai; these methods are being applied to problems in the
human genome project and the design of adaptive agents.  
automated deduction
studies methods for computer generation of formal proofs in logical systems,
and is being applied to deductive databases and to discovering new
mathematical theorems.

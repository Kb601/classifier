 mathematical programming research and education in the computer sciences department 

this is the world wide web home page for the math programming group in the 

university of wisconsin computer sciences department.
mathematical programming is the study of constrained and unconstrained
optimization problems. theory, algorithms and applications are 
principal areas of research. a great variety of problems in nature,
the physical and biological sciences appear naturally as constrained
optimization problems, or can be easily cast as such problems.
major divisions of the field include: linear and nonlinear programming,
integer programming, complementarity problems and  variational inequalities.

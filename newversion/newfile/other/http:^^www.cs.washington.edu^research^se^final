welcome to the home page for  software engineering  research
and education in the department of computer science &
engineering at the university
of washington.

software engineering is a diverse area, and the projects and faculty
in our department reflect that.  in general, we are interested in
ensuring that complex software systems exhibit specific properties.
recently, the three properties that we have focused on are: 
software safety ( nancy
leveson), which concerns how to guarantee that systems with
embedded software cause no harm to human life, the environment, or
property; ease of evolution (david notkin),
which concerns reducing the costs and complexity of changing software
systems over time; and real-time attributes (alan
shaw), which concerns understanding and guaranteeing that certain
timing constraints are satisfied.

in addition to continuing work on these and related properties, our
current work is characterized in two ways.  first, we are interested
in understanding how properties interact: for instance, how does one
(or can one) build safe systems that can be modified easily?  second,
what are the problems that arise in the construction of real software
systems?  we have a history of working on such systems; our group has
had interactions with the faa on tcas, the collison avoidance system
now found on all planes of over 30 passengers, with microsoft on
helping them with an experimental restructuring of their 1.2 million
line excel product, and with local medical device companies who need
to demonstrate that their products satisfy both safety and timing
requirements.  

faculty, students, etc.  interested primarily in software engineering
are listed below, but other people in the department dabble in
software engineering research and education from time to time.

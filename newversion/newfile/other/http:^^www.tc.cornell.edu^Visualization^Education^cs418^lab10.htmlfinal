cs 418: laboratory 10 
 physically based animation

 introduction. 
in this lab you will use physical (i.e. forces and accelerations)
descriptions of processes to animate objects. 
there are several good reasons why you may want to compute motion of objects
based on forces, rather than attempt a kinematic description of object motion.

 it is often easier to write an expression for the forces on an object
(a differential equation) than it is to directly describe the motion.
 dynamic systems based on forces evolve "automatically" so than the motion
is physically correct (given the correct equations). this automatic behavior
relieves the animator of attention to lots of boring detail.
 for chaotic systems it is impossible to write a kinematic description.

refer to the section on
 dynamics  in the cs 417 page for more information 
about solving dynamic systems. three examples are shown here of systems
which would be difficult or impossible to animate by manual kinematic
description.

 load macros and move to your .dxmacros directory

 bug as of 3/4/96  
after you donwload the nbodygmacro.net, open it and remove the set module, 
then replace it with a new set module, then reconnect it and save it. 
(the internal state
of the module seems to be messed up).


execute the programs to understand their behavior, then modify them as
follows:


 modify the nbodygravity.net to allow other force laws besides inverse square.
provide an interactor to set the exponent on the law from inverse first
power to inverse fourth power. can you make a stable orbit with just two
gravitating bodies for inverse first power or inverse third power force
laws?
 modify the linear wave equation given in program 2dlinearwave.net
to simulate water by making the acceleration
proportional to depth. refer to the
 dynamics section for more information on water
waves.
make the 2d function which represents the bottom
of the region containing the water have some variation with position, perhaps
a gaussian hillock:
note correction on 3/13/96. a missing minus sign was added.
 z = -1 + 0.7*exp(-((x-0.5)^2 + (y-0.5)^2)/0.2)  
when the modified program is running correctly, the water wave should slow down
over the bump, and will bounce off the bump if it is above the surface. 

 modify the water-wave program you just wrote to simulate a
cannon firing a ball through the air and into water where it starts a
wave. use a euler integrator for the ball (and the given verlet integrator for
the water).  the ball should have initial conditions
of position corresponding to the muzzle of the cannon and a velocity
consistent with the cannon's altitude (angle with the horizontal)
and azimuth (horizontal direction).
you should be able to set the altitude and azimuth of the cannon
via interactors, which means you will have to detect where and when the
ball hits the water surface (which is flat until the ball hits it). you
will need to figure out how to notify the water simulation that the ball
hit, perhaps by adding a sudden velocity to the water where the ball
hit.
  there should be interactors to set the
force of gravity on the ball, g and the air drag coefficient, 
r.
for the ball assume that: 
ax = - r*vx 
ay = - r*vy 
az = -g - r*vz

where  [vx, vy, vz] are the components of the velocity, and 
[ax, ay, az] the components of the accelaration.



be prepared to demo the two programs in section. you will also need to 
demonstrate  mpeg  movies of final results 
including:

 an orbit (if any), in an inverse first power field.
 one paticular cannon shot into the water.



you should be able to explain your programs. you should use
transmitters/receivers, macros, and comments 
in the "notation" field of each module
so that you and the grader can understand the program. 
control panels, if any,
should be well organized, labeled, and with the appropriate numeric ranges.


some results from 1996. 

the
 lab 10 grading guide 
will be filled out by a consultant during section to evaluate your work.

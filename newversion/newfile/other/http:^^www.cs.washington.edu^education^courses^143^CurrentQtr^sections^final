cse 143 notes and handouts from sections

here's some stuff from section that includes supplementary notes,
hints on homework, sample code, and other handouts:


mazegen
apparently there has been some demand for information about how we
generated our random mazes.  here's some information about
mazegen, our maze generator, and related
algorithms.


big-o analysis exercise

with an eye towards the quiz on thursday, michael made up the
following big-o analysis
exercise.  questions and answers are available, and are likely to
be similar to what might be asked on the quiz.  take a look!  topics
cover much of what we have talked about in lecture the past week or
so. 


hw2 info

for people in andy's sections (aa and ae), here is some additional

explanations for the hw2 grading.

pointer chasing exercise

this is a exercise in chasing pointers in c++ programs by drawing
pictures and evaluating c++ code.  although the code is neither
beautiful nor meaningful, it's designed to give you practice with
assigning pointers and traversing linked structures using them.  if
you understand it, you can probably also debug your own programs using
pointers (though hopefully they'll do it in a more intelligent way).
both the original exercise
and a solution set are
available.  please let brad know if you find any
mistakes.



example adt

here is an example of an adt for a string class.
this should give you some ideas as to how to set up modules and what
to put where.  plus it's just interesting.



another sample adt
and here's another example of an adt.  this one is an implementation of
a fraction class.  two versions are provided:
a simple, well-documented version that emulates the kind of files you'll
be responsible for turning in, and a more complex and under-documented
version for the curious.



slides

on-line versions of the lecture slides (6 per page) are available
here, in postscript and acrobat formats.

on the lab machines acrobat reader is automatically
started up by netscape when you follow the link.


 on other macs, pc compatibles, and some versions of unix
    acrobat reader may be downloaded free directly from 
    adobe.
    this web site also includes instructions for setting your web browser to
    invoke acrobat reader automatically.  some versions of
    ghostscript
    also support acrobat.

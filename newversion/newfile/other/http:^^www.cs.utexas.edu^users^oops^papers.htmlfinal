paul r. wilson. portable runtime type
description for conventional compilers.  submitted to
usenix '97.



many useful language extensions and support libraries require knowledge of
the layout of fields within objects at runtime.  examples include orthogonal
persistent object stores, garbage collectors, data structure picklers, 
parameter marshalling schemes, etc.

for clean and efficient implementation as libraries, these systems require
knowledge of the actual layouts of data objects, which is unavailable in
most traditionally-compiled and linked programming languages, such as c, c++,
and ada.

we present a facility for runtime type description, or
rttd, which extracts the low-level layout information from debug output of
conventional compilers, and makes it available to user programs.  we describe
the basic strategies of the system, and present details of our interface for
c++.  we also sketch some extensions we have implemented, including special
treatment of c++'s virtual function table pointers.

our implementation is freely available via anonymous ftp.

  michael neely. an analysis of the
effects of memory allocation policy on storage fragmentation.
master's thesis, the university of texas at austin, may 1996.  


the study of dynamic memory allocation has been dominated by
measurement of performance of allocators with random input streams of
requests. this study introduces a new methodology that separates the
issue of policy from implementation and focuses on the effects of
placement policy on fragmentation.  it studies the effects of policy
decisions such as object placement, splitting, and coalescing, on
storage fragmentation. a useful and accurate measurement of
fragmentation is presented that is based on the amount of waste at the
point of peak memory usage. we have attempted to pick a representative
set of allocators from the space of reasonable combinations of known
policies. the allocators are used in memory allocation simulations to
determine their respective fragmentation.

our results show that the best fit (fifo, lifo or address-ordered) and
address-ordered first fit policies yield the lowest fragmentation on
average (14%), and that the overheads associated with these allocators
are the largest source of wasted memory. we also explain how best fit
can be implemented efficiently. a representative set of real program
allocation traces is used in the simulations, and compared with
randomized traces, to show that the application's patterns of
allocation are an important factor in the allocator's performance and
that studies based on synthetic traces are fundamentally flawed.

  paul r. wilson, mark s. johnstone, michael
neely, and david boles. dynamic storage allocation:
a survey and critical review. in international workshop on 
memory management, kinross, scotland, uk, september 1995.  


dynamic memory allocation has been a fundamental part of most computer
systems since roughly 1960, and memory allocation is widely
considered to be either a solved problem or an insoluble one.
in this survey, we describe a variety of memory allocator designs
and point out issues relevant to their design and evaluation.  we
then chronologically survey most of the literature on allocators between
1961 and 1995.  (scores of papers are discussed, in varying detail,
and over 150 references are given.)

we argue that allocator designs have been unduly restricted by
an emphasis on mechanism, rather than policy, while the latter is
more important;  higher-level strategic issues are still
more important, but have not been given much attention.

most theoretical analyses and empirical allocator evaluations to date 
have relied on very strong assumptions of randomness and independence, 
but real program behavior exhibits important regularities that must be
exploited if allocators are to perform well in practice.

shubhendu s. mukherjee. anomalies and adaptation in the analysis
and development of prefetching policies.  journal of systems
and software, 27(2):147-153, november 1994. 
technical communication. 


in "analysis and development of demand prepaging policies,"
horspool and huberman show that it is possible to
design prefetching memory policies that preserve a "stack"
inclusion property, much like lru, allowing them to simulate
these policies for all sizes of memory in a single pass through
a reference trace.  we believe that the details of horspool and
huberman's algorithms introduce unexpected anomalous properties,
however.  in particular, their policies are not properly
timescale relative--events occuring on a timescale
that should only matter to
some sizes of memory adversely affect replacement decisions
for memories of very different sizes.  slight changes to the
algorithms can restore timescale relativity and make them much
better-behaved.  in addition, we would like to point out that
horspool and huberman's algorithms actually simulate adaptive
policies, which may explain some of their unexpectedly positive
results.  this view suggests that properly timescale-relative
inclusion-preserving policies can be used to systematically
evaluate adaptive memory management schemes.

collection techniques. in international workshop on memory
management, st. malo, france, september 1992. (the proceedings
has been published as springer-verlag lecture notes in computer
science no. 637).  


we survey basic garbage collection algorithms, and variations such as
incremental and generational collection.  the basic algorithms include
reference counting, mark-sweep, mark-compact, copying, and treadmill
collection. incremental techniques can keep garbage collection
pause times short, by interleaving small amounts of collection work
with program execution.  generational schemes improve efficiency and
locality by garbage collecting a smaller area more often, while
exploiting typical lifetime characteristics to avoid undue overhead
from long-lived objects.

  paul r. wilson. uniprocessor garbage
collection techniques. draft of much expanded version of the above
paper. in revision (accepted for acm computing surveys). 


we survery basic garbage collection algorithms, and variations such as
incremental and generational collection; we then discuss low-level
implementation considerations and relationships between storage
management systems, languages, and compilers. throughout, we attempt
to present a unified view based on abstract traversal strategies,
addressing issues of conservatism, opportunism, and immediacy of
reclamation; we also point out a variety of implemetation details that
are likely to have significant impact on the performance.

  paul r. wilson and sheetal v. kakkad. pointer
swizzling at page fault time: efficiently and compatibly supporting
huge address spaces on standard hardware. in international
workshop on object orientation in operating systems, pages
364-377, paris, france, september 1992. 


pointer swizzling at page fault time is a novel address translation
mechanism that exploits conventional address translation hardware.  it
can support huge address spaces efficiently without long hardware
addresses; such large address spaces are attractive for persistent
object stores, distributed shared memories, and shared address space
operating systems.  this swizzling scheme can be used to provide data
compatibility across machines with different word sizes, and even to
provide binary code compatibility across machines with different
hardware address sizes.

pointers are translated ("swizzled") from a long format to a shorter
hardware-supported format at page fault time.  no extra hardware is
required, and no continual software overhead is incurred by presence
checks or indirection of pointers.  this pagewise technique exploits
temporal and spatial locality in much the same way as a normal virtual
memory; this gives it many desirable performance characteristics,
especially given the trend toward larger main memories.  it is easy to
implement using common compilers and operating systems.

 texas: an efficient, portable persistent store. in 
persistent object systems: proceedings of the fifth international
workshop on persistent object systems, pages 11-33, san
miniato, italy, september 1992. 


texas is a persistent storage system for c++, providing high
performance while emphasizing simplicity, modularity and portability.
a key component of the design is the use of pointer swizzling at page
fault time, which exploits existing virtual memory features to
implement large address spaces efficiently on stock hardware, with
little or no change to existing compilers. long pointers are used to
implement an enormous address space, but are transparently converted
to the hardware-supported pointer format when pages are loaded into
virtual memory.

runtime type descriptors and slightly modified heap allocation
routines support pagewise pointer swizzling by allowing objects
and their pointer fields to be identified within pages.  if compiler
support for runtime type identification is not available, a simple
preprocessor can be used to generate type descriptors.

this address translation is largely independent of issues of data
caching, sharing, and checkpointing; it employs operating systems'
existing virtual memories for caching, and a simple and flexible
log-structured storage manager to improve checkpointing performance.

pagewise virtual memory protections are also used to detect writes for
logging purposes, without requiring any changes to compiled code.
this may degrade checkpointing performance for small transactions with
poor locality of writes, but page diffing and sub-page logging promise
to keep performance competitive with finer-grained checkpointing
schemes.

texas presents a simple programming interface; an application creates
persistent object by simply allocating them on the persistent heap.
in addition, the implementation is relatively small, and is easy to
incorporate into existing applications. the log-structured storage
module easily supports advanced extensions such as compressed storage,
versioning, and adaptive reorganization.

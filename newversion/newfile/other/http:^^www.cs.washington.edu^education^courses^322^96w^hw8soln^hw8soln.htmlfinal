consider the nfa  
where  is given by the table:


we can construct a dfa  where 
 is given by the table (using the subset construction):


and where 
 
and
.

 
below are the steps for converting the nfa of problem 1 into a regular
expression. we start with the original nfa:





first, we make a new start state that has no incoming arcs:





next, make a new final state with no outgoing arcs:





eliminate a state.  the state  looks like a good candidate:





eliminate state :





eliminate :





accounting for the final start state, the equivalent regular expression is
. this can be simplified to
.
 
 proof that that regular languages are closed under reversal:
suppose the language l over  is regular.  
it must be accepted by some nfa 
.  
consider the nfa  where


we will show that  accepts  with the following behavioral lemma:

 behavioral lemma: for all , 
 if and only if 
.

given that this lemma is true, we can prove that .
suppose  and .  let x = ay for 
and .  note that .  it follows that:


suppose that  and .  again, let x=ay:


consider when :


combining these observations, we have , and so 
there is an nfa that accepts .
thus, if l is regular,  is regular.

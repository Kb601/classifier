industrial impact of computer architecture research
at the university of wisconsin-madison (updated june 1994)

this document highlights the industrial impact of
research in computer architecture at the
university of wisconsin since 1980.
there are four broad areas of contributions:
(i) processor design, with an emphasis of instruction-level
parallel processor technology, (ii) cache memory systems,
(iii) multiprocessor systems, and (iv) enabling technologies.

processor technologies
one of the early contributions in instruction level parallel (also
called ilp) processor technology was the development
of the decoupled architecture concept.
developed before the term ``superscalar'' was coined,
a decoupled architecture is, 
in fact, a superscalar architecture that supports
issuing multiple instructions per cycle from a sequential instruction stream.
what is now commonly regarded as the first commercially-available superscalar
processor, the astronautics zs-1, appeared in 1988 and was developed
as a direct spin-off of the university of wisconsin research efforts.
since the zs-1, many superscalar processors have used the decoupled architecture
principles to separate addressing activity from computation activity,
thereby increasing the amount of instruction level parallelism
that can be exploited.  recent processors which follow the decoupled
architecture principles include the ibm power series of processors,
and the silicon graphics r8000 (previously called the silicon graphics tfp).

another major contribution was the development of precise interrupt
and register renaming techniques for out-of-order instruction execution.
smith and pleszkun provided the first published work directed specifically
at implementation of precise interrupts.  this paper laid out the
fundamental problems and proposed a number of solutions and techniques.
sohi extended the precise interrupt maintenance mechanisms to carry out
register renaming, and articulated the organization of a dynamically-scheduled
superscalar processor using register renaming and having precise interrupts.
this body of research has been fundamental to
the emergence of superscalar processors in the 1990s.
the mechanisms proposed by uw researchers are
at the core of many modern superscalar processors, including the motorola 88110,
the recently-announced powerpc 604, and the upcoming powerpc 620.
several other soon-to-be-announced superscalar processors
also have the above mechanisms at their core.

industrially-relevant work in ilp processors is continuing at uw.
recent research contributions include novel ways of integrating
guarded execution into existing instruction sets and a new
paradigm for exploiting instruction level parallelism.
this new paradigm, called multiscalar,
has several inherent properties that make it more promising than the
existing superscalar and vliw paradigms for a turn-of-the-century processor.

cache memory systems
wisconsin researchers have also had a long history of
contributions in the design of memory systems, particularly caches.
anticipating the era when memory bandwidth would severely restrict
system performance,
goodman showed that caches can be used not only to reduce
average memory latency but also to limit peak memory bandwidth requirements
by focusing on temporal, rather than spatial, locality.
wisconsin researchers provided much of the motivation for the
recent shift from set-associative to direct-mapped caches.
smith and goodman showed circumstances under which
direct-mapped caches obtain better hit ratios than fully associative caches.
hill demonstrated that direct-mapped caches can yield better
performance than set-associative ones despite having larger
miss ratios, and provided insight into cache design with
the 3c model which separates the compulsory, capacity,
and conflict components of the miss ratio.

in the area of cache design,
goodman showed how static-column drams (scrams)
can be used as a "poor man's"
cache, providing some of the benefits of cache memory without using sram.
hill and wood participated in the first studies of 
multi-megabyte cache design (which some contemporaries
criticized as never to become practical).
sohi showed why processors would have to change from using (then prevalent)
blocking caches to non-blocking caches as they became more
aggressive in exploiting ilp.

each one of these contributions can be found, to varying extents,
in modern computer systems.
for example, both sun microsystems and compaq have built
computers containing scram caches,
direct-mapped caches are now at least as common as set-associative ones,
multi-megabyte second level caches are widely used,
and most recently-announced superscalar microprocessors
use non-blocking caches.
multiprocessor systems

in multiprocessor systems, goodman published the first paper
describing a snooping cache coherence protocol.
snooping cache protocols enabled 
the construction of shared-bus multiprocessors,
also called symmetric multiprocessors, in the marketplace.
such multiprocessors were one of the earliest
available general-purpose multiprocessor systems and
have become the most common form of multiprocessing available today.
among the earliest snooping-cache systems were the
sequent balance and the encore multimax,
both of which were directly influenced by the wisconsin work.
some microprocessors, such as the motorola 88000,
have implemented almost exactly the write-once protocol as
described by goodman.  recent multiprocessor workstations
and servers, such as those manufactured by sun microsystems,
also use snooping cache protocols.

goodman and sohi contributed to the ieee standard 1596
scalable coherent interface,
the first commercial-grade directory-based coherence scheme.
goodman contributed extensively to the basic cache coherence protocol,
and to the development of options for achieving higher performance.
goodman and sohi were primary contributors to the development of
protocols for large numbers of caches (kiloprocessor extensions).
the convex exemplar system is the first commercial system
to use the scalable coherent interface,
but many other systems are currently under development,
including at unisys and ibm.

goodman and vernon developed the first synchronizing prefetch primitive,
which was incorporated in the sci standard.
this technique, known as qolb,
for synchronizing shared memory accesses,
also inspired software implementations for implementing
efficient locks that minimize network traffic during contention.
in particular, the qolb-inspired mcs lock has become the standard
locking mechanism for shared-memory multiprocessors.
another synchronization mechanism invented by uw researchers is a
novel technique to combine fetch&increment operations.
the applicability of this technique is likely to grow
as more powerful multiprocessors, with more aggressive synchronization
requirements, are built.

another area of contributions is
memory consistency models which specify the semantics of shared memory.
wisconsin researchers were among the first to recognize that memory
consistency was not synonymous with cache coherence.  goodman defined
processor consistency that codified the general effect of buffering
writes.  hill showed how weak ordering could be viewed as sequential
consistency (the strongest model) by data-race-free programs.  this
formalization and subsequent generalizations allow more sophisticated
compiler and hardware optimizations than were previously possible.  the
full industrial impact of memory consistency models has yet to be felt,
however, and probably must await the wide deployment of out-of-order
issue processors, non-blocking caches, and software/hardware hybrid
coherence solutions.

practical research in multiprocessors is continuing at wisconsin.
recent research includes
contributions in the ``middle interface'': below languages and
compilers and above system software and hardware.
for example, uw researchers are developing tempest,
a novel approach to provide support for shared-memory,
message-passing, and hybrid combinations of the two.

enabling technologies
the design of a computer system requires quantitative assessments
of various design criteria.  wisconsin researchers have advanced both
theory and practice of these important enabling technologies.
hill developed new algorithms, and software tools that use these algorithms,
for simultaneously simulating multiple alternative cache organizations.
larus developed new techniques, and software tools using these techniques, 
for rewriting executables to profile programs.
wood and hill advanced the state-of-the-art of
trace sampling techniques, which are important techniques in the
study of very large caches.

equally important, wisconsin researchers have transferred
their new techniques and software tools to industry and academia so that
others can synergistically build on the work.
tools such as ae, cprof, dinero,
tycho, qpt, have
been used at more than one thousand other
(academic and industrial) sites.
uw researchers have also provided data that industry uses to design
computers.  for example, designers can download spec miss ratio
data from our ftp site, which would otherwise require four machine years 
to regenerate. 

more recently, uw researchers developed the wisconsin wind
tunnel, the first effective parallel simulator of parallel computers.
running on a thinking machines cm-5, the wisconsin wind
tunnel permits efficient evaluation of real application performance on
proposed hardware.

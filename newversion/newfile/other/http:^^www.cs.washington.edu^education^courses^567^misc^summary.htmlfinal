cse 567: principles of digital systems design
carl ebeling, fall 1996 



catalog data: principles of logic design, combinational and
sequential circuits, structured design methods, digital system
components, clocking methodologies, arithmetic circuits, memories,
hardware description languages, logic and sequential synthesis,
synthesis and simulation tools, implementation alternative, vlsi
processor architecture, application-specific computation.


prerequisites:
a working knowledge of boolean algebra and finite-state machines.
familiarity with the department's computing environment: unix/x


course goals:
to provide in-depth understanding of digital systems and their 
design, including specification, synthesis, and implementation.


facilities:
you will be making extensive use of computer-aided design (cad) tools
for designing and implementing digital circuits.  these tools are
installed on the sun workstations of the northwest laboratory for
integrated systems (lis).  these are (mostly) located in sieg 424 but
are accessible from any x-terminal.  you may find it advantageous to
work in 424 where you can take advantage of manuals, reference texts
and the knowledge of other students.

 cad tools: cad tools allow us to design and implement
substantial hardware projects in a reasonable amount of time.  they
also provide hands-on experience with state-of-the-art design tools
that incorporate the synthesis algorithms covered in class.  these
tools are introduced during the first half of the course as basic
concepts are covered and then used heavily for the design project.


 verilog:  verilog is a text-based hardware description
  language which allows both structural and behavioral descriptions.
  this course concentrates on structural design but introduces
  behavioral descriptions and synthesis.  cadence tools are used to
  simulate the verilog descriptions.



  synopsys  the synopsys synthesis tools are used to
  synthesize implementations from the verilog descriptions.  this
  course uses synopsys to investigate the synthesis process as well as a
  ``turn-key'' synthesis for implementing the final project.



assignments: there will be weekly assignments and labs during
the first half of the quarter.  they will give you experience with
the concepts you will be using in the second half of the quarter for
the design project and introduce you to the cad tools.



project: a substantial part of the course revolves around the
team design of a large hardware systems project.  each team will
design a complete project using schematics and verilog for
specification, verilog-xl for simulation, the synopsys tools for
synthesis, and xilinx fpgas for implementation.  design projects in
the past have included a tetris player, an ethernet interface, a cache
monitor and dna sequence matching.  this quarter we will be designing
hardware to implement an image processing algorithm.  i haven't
decided which algorithm yet, but examples include 
compression, filtering, edge detection, etc.  we will be using a
prototyping board containing several fpgas and ram that plugs into an
alpha workstation via a pci bus.  an image will be downloaded into the
on-board ram, transformed by the hardware into a compressed or
filtered image, and then uploaded to the alpha.  the project will be
well-defined, but students will be able to explore different options
based on performance or cost as well as other possibilities such as
color images or video.



collaborative learning:
it is well known that students can learn a lot from each other given
the chance.  during the second week i will assign everyone into teams
of three and four students.  you will work together on the homework
assignments and the project.  each member of the team will be
responsible for the performance of all other team members; that is,
the entire team must understand the solution and contribute to part of
it.  we will talk about how this works in more detail later.


quizzes and exams:
there will be a short but challenging quiz every friday at the end of
class which will cover all material covered through that wednesday.
as compensation, there will be no mid-term exam.  the final exam will
be a two-hour comprehensive examination given at the regularly
scheduled final exam time.  quizzes and the final exam will be open
book and open notes.


grading:
the course grade will be roughly determined as follows:

  assignments (homework and laboratory): 20%
  quizzes: 20%
  project: 40%
  final exam: 20%
  participation and intangibles: 10%

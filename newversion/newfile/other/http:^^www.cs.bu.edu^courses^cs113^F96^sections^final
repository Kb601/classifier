midterm coding solutions

here you'll find example solutions to problems 8-10 from the
midterm.


problems 8-10


lecture notes

here you will find stuff that relates to what was covered in a
specific week's discussion or online lectures relating to the
homeworks.  it is not meant as a substitute for coming to the
discussions, but contains a subset of the same material.


lab 1: week of sept. 9

  
  example program: average program
  
lab 2: week of sept. 16

  
  how to make emacs color-code c programs

  lab homework
  





unix references


emacs - text editor - quick reference

unix files and file hierarchy
unix pathnames and emacs





meeting times





daytimeroom
tue5-6pmmcs-b23 or unix lab (b24)
wed9-10ammcs-b31 or unix lab (b24)


often discussions will be in the unix lab (b24).  when i plan to have
discussions in the computer labs, i put a sign outside the assigned
classroom.



each of the 2 discussions will cover roughly the same material
as the other.  if you cannot make the discussion that
you are assigned to, feel free to come to the other one;
however, the number of computers in the lab are limited.




rob's hours





daytimeroom
mon1-2pmunix lab (b24)
mon2-4pmmcs-223
tue6-7pmunix lab (b24)
wed10-11amunix lab (b24)



when i am in the unix lab, i am there to assist all 100-level computer
science course students and help will be available on a first-come-first-serve
basis.

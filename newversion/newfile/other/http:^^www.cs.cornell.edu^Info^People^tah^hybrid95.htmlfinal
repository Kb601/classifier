organizers, sponsors, and program committee
this workshop is organized as a part of the dimacs 1995-96 

special year on logic and algorithms.  
dimacs
is a science and technology center funded by 
the national science foundation, and the participating institutions are 
rutgers university, princeton university, at&t bell laboratories, and
bellcore.  the co-sponsor of this workshop is
sycon, 
a rutgers university center dedicated to research in control theory and 
closely associated topics.

registration, travel, and accomodation information
registration
please email the 

registration form
to pat toci at toci@dimacs.rutgers.edu (908-445-5930).  
there is no registration fee.
travel and hotel information
it is recommended that participants arriving by plane fly into newark
airport.  flying into kennedy or la guardia can add more than an hour
to the travel time to dimacs.

dimacs has successfully and quite pleasantly used the comfort inn and
the holiday inn, both in south plainfield, new jersey--they are next to 
each other.  the comfort inn gives participants of dimacs workshops the 
special rate of $47.00 ($52.00 if two guests share a room), and the 
holiday inn gives dimacs the special rate of $60.00 per room (includes 
a continental breakfast).  the comfort inn's phone number is 908-561-4488.  
the holiday inn's phone number is 908-753-5500.  

the comfort inn provides free van service to and from newark airport. 
you need to give them a 24-hour notice.  to travel between newark airport 
and the holiday inn, we recommend ics van service, 800-225-4427 (for 
inside the united states) or 908-566-0795.  the rate is $23.00 per person.  
it must be booked in advance.  from the new york airports, participants 
may take the grayline air (bus) shuttle (800-451-0455) to newark airport,
and then ics van service from there.

the first day of the workshop (october 22) will be held at the holiday inn.  
all workshop events on october 23-25 will take place at dimacs, located in 
the core building of rutgers university, busch campus, in piscataway, new 
jersey.  both the comfort inn and the holiday inn provide free van service 
to and from dimacs.  participants arriving to dimacs by car need a parking 
permit.  parking permits will be available in the hotels and at the 
registration table.  please be sure to park in lot 64.

for further questions regarding local transportation and accomodations, or 
to obtain detailed driving directions to the hotels and to dimacs, contact 
pat toci at toci@dimacs.rutgers.edu (908-445-5930).  
full-time students
the participation of graduate students at the workshop is strongly 
encouraged.  dimacs provides funds to partially reimburse the cost of travel 
and accommodation for students.  if you are a full-time student and wish to 
be considered for travel support, please mark the registration form 
appropriately.  (the support level per person will depend on the number of 
student participants.)

cs 418: laboratory 0  
 getting started with dataexplorer. 

these instructions will introduce you to 
dataexplorer (dx)
and the lab facilities in the cornell university
computer science department
and in the 
cornell theory center.
dx is a software package intended to
be used for scientific visualization. at the start of the semester we will use it as a
rendering/viewing platform for various computer graphics procedures. machines to
run dx are located in room 335 in upson and in room 471 in the
e&tc building.
there are several sections:

  basic information 

your first dx session (see below).
 unix for cs 418. 
 dx data structures.
 dx use notes and warnings. 


  further information 

  
submitting still images and animation for the course web pages.
  
creating mpeg animation files. 
 there are some dx techniques outlined in the
 dx repository  
which may be useful later in the semester.
you may also want to look at some 

 student programming projects  using dx.
  disk space: 
we have set up a temporary 1.7 gbyte partition for cs 418 use at 
 /afs/theory/tc/courses/cs418/tmp  
you should consider it scratch space for mpeg compression. materials are
subject to deletion after 24 hours.
 to use it:
 
make sure (on the hp machines) that 
 /usr/local/afsws/bin  is in your
path. on the ibm machines, skip this step.
 issue the command klog,
then enter your ibm system password.
on the ibm machines, skip this step.
 issue a cd command to  /afs/theory/tc/courses/cs418/tmp 

 make a directory for your materials






your first dx session.

to get started, login to one of the 
 machines (hp700 or ibm rs6000). 

 on the ibm machines
you will need to start x-windows using the  'xinit' command.  
 on the hp machines
 x-windows starts automatically.  
 
 the first time you login you will need to load a few files and 
 modify your .cshrc file. if you don't know how to do this in unix
 ask a consultant or check ou the 
 unix intro  page.
 
  click 
  here 
 to download some utilities you will need. when the dialog box appears,
 save the file as "macros.tar" in your home directory.
  execute the command  
 tar -xvf macros.tar   this will put the utilities in a new
 directory called .dxmacros.
  add the line setenv dxmacros
 ~myid/.dxmacros
  to your  .cshrc  file.
note that "myid" is a placeholder for your user id.
 execute the command
 source .cshrc  
this will cause the macros to become available to dx when it starts up.
this command is executed automatically whenever you login or open a new window.
 
 anytime you start a session,
make sure you have a c-shell running (type  csh ) then start dx by typing  'dx'. 

at the end
of a session, 

on the ibm machines kill x-windows by typing  cntl-alt-backspace. 
then  logout.
 on the hp machines logout from the desktop.


dx has extensive on-line help, including tutorials and a complete manual which you
can look at  by clicking the help menu in the upper right of the editor window. you
can also click the middle button over any object (module, menu) to get context
sensitive help.

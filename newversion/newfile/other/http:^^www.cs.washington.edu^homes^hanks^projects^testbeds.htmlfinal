planning testbeds and empirical evaluation of agents 


       the truckworld testbed  is a challenging 
       software environment to exercise your planning agent.  it 
       allows you to model
         
           multiple agents that can communicate and cooperate
           a rich set of objects that the agent can manipulate 
           exogenous events
           actions that fail randomly and in a state-dependent way
           complex sensing and communication devices 
           easy customization to your problem domain.
         
       the  
                  truckworld beginner's guide  
                 provides an overview of the 
                 system's basic functionality, and tells you how to set up
                 the system and run a simulation.
           the truckworld code is available via anonymous ftp or 
                by clicking 
                  
                    here,  (but send mail 
                to  truckworld-request@cs.washington.edu  
                if you use the code, so we can send you updates and 
                bug fixes).
         
      the paper 
          
             benchmarks, testbeds, controlled experimentation and the design of 
                  agent architectures 
          is a broader overview of the issues involved with building good testbeds 
          and evaluating an agent's performance.  this paper appeared in 
          ai magazine  winter 1993, and is joint 
         work with  
               martha pollack 
                and 
              paul cohen.

hi!  i'm now a masters of engineering student in the
computer science department here at cornell.  i graduated last
year and majored in economics, mathematics, and computer
science.  i currently work for professor brian smith and t.a. that wonderful
course, 
cs99.  and i'm one of the thousands of oklahomans secretly populating
and subverting the northeast (at last count, i believe there are 20 or so
students from the mother land here at cornell).  if you want to start
some trouble or just chuck a few comments at me, shoot.

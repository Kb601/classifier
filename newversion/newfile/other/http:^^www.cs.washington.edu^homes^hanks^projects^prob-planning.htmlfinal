probabilistic planning


adapting classical planning algorithms
to deal with uncertainty about the world state and the effects of 
actions:
    
        the buridan planner  is a first 
         attempt at a probabilitic planner, and explores issues 
         like what the action and state representation should 
         be, and how the problem of  evaluating  a partially 
         generated plan interacts with  generating  a plan. 
         buridan assumes the agent will get no additional information 
         about the world at execution time.
        the conditional buridan planner is an extension that allows
        actions to provide  information  about the world as well 
        as  change  the world.   this is joint work with 
         dan weld  
                and 
         
           denise draper.

                     probabilistic planning with information gathering and contingent 
                     execution   which appears in the aips94 proceedings.

                       which appears in the aips94 proceedings.

       also see information on the uwl language, which is 
       a symbolic (non-probabilistic) approach to planning with 
       information-producing actions and conditionals.

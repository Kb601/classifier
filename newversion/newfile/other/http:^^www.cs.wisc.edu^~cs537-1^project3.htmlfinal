introduction 

a program has been written that simulates a short-term scheduler and
allows you to experiment with various scheduling policies. your assignment
is to measure and analyze the performance of several policies, modifying
the simulation program as necessary. 

running the simulator 

the current version of the program simulates round-robin (rr)
scheduling, but it is constructed to allow easy modification for other
scheduling policies. the program expects the following command line: 

java proj3 [-v...] [-t] data-file quantum 



proj3: name of the main class. 

-v, -vv, etc.: starts verbose mode for debugging. verbose
mode causes the simulator to print debugging output to the screen. the
more v's in the command line, the greater the verbosity. 

-t: starts trace mode. trace mode causes the simulator to maintain
a record of all significant events. 

data-file: name of the file containing the trace data used in
the simulation. 

quantum: length of the time-slice used in round-robin scheduling.


system overview


the simulator essentially consists of jobs, devices, and schedulers -- all
coordinated by a single loop of code.
a job is a customer of services: it is a process that needs to use
system resources during its execution. a device represents a resource
in the system. in this simulation, the devices available to a job are the cpu 
and the disk.
there is also a clock device and a pseudo-device that interrupts whenever
a new job arrives in the system.
a scheduler coordinates access to a device. it queues jobs
that are waiting to use a device and will choose which job is the next
to access.

the overall execution of the simulator occurs like this:  jobs arrive at
the jobarrival device and are entered into the system.  a job's lifetime
consists of alternating periods of using the cpu (called a 
burst) and performing i/o. the main loop is responsible for 
moving jobs around the system.  it sends them to a scheduler, takes
the next job from a scheduler, and starts and stops jobs running on a device.
the disk scheduler and the cpu scheduler decide which job should
be the next to run on their respective devices.  they also buffer jobs that
are waiting to run but have not yet been given access.  the clock device is
used to enable preemption (more on this later).

(more than is necessary to do this assignment), you can either read the
comments in the code itself, or click

program modification

for this project, you are going to be focusing almost exclusively on
the cpu scheduler object shown above.  the provided simulator performs 
round-robin (rr) scheduling.  you are to create separate versions 
of the simulator to implement each of the cpu scheduling algorithms described 
below. 


modify one copy of the program to simulate the shortest-job-first
(sjf) algorithm described in section 2.4.4 of the text. the next process
to be run is the one with the smallest burst. use fcfs to break ties.
because this is a simulation, you can ``cheat''
by looking at the burst length of a process when deciding which process
to run next. in a real system, that information is not available to the
scheduler.

this policy is non-preemptive: newly arriving processes do not affect
the currently-running process.


modify another copy of the program to implement a preemptive
version of sjf, which is called shortest-remaining-time-first (srtf).
in this algorithm, the currently-running process is the one with the least
time left in its current burst.

for your final version of the program, modify the sjf algorithm
to use a predicted burst length. we will call this policy predicted-shortest-job-first
(psjf). you can predict the burst length by using an exponential average
of the measured lengths of previous cpu bursts. the formula is as follows:



        
                        tn+1 = atn + (1 - a)tn


t = predicted burst length 

t = past measurement of actual burst length 

0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1 



what the formula says is that the predicted value of the next burst
length (tn+1) will be dependent upon both the last measured
burst length (tn) and the last predicted burst length
(tn). the weight the previous two measurements have in
calculating the new prediction is contained in a. if a = 1/2,
then they will both contribute equally; if a = 1, then only the
last measured burst time is used to predict the next burst time. experiment
with different values of a for this section. 
to implement psjf you will have to modify the job class to
record a little more information.


you should have four versions of the simulation program when finished,



the original (rr) 

one for sjf 

one for srtf

and one for psjf. 


files
the files you will need can be found in 
 
    ~cs537-1/public/src

they include all of the files for the simulator, the data file, and a makefile.
copy all of these files into one of your directories and type
make to run the round-robin version of the 
simulator.

coding

the easiest way to attack this assignment is to modify a copy of the provided
round-robin scheduler.

 
    cp rrscheduler.java sjfscheduler.java

don't forget to change all occurrences of rrscheduler
to sjfscheduler in the copy and in the makefile.

you should also change the following line in the file sim.java
so your scheduler is used by the simulator instead of the default:

 
    sim.java: 
        cpuscheduler = new rrscheduler();

    becomes 
        cpuscheduler = new sjfscheduler(); 


the methods in rrscheduler which you will have to modify for your assignment
include:

boolean add(job,timeleft)
adds a new job wanting service.
the second parameter is the amount of cpu time remaining until the job
currently using the cpu will next do i/o or finish.
it is -1 if the cpu is currently idle.
this method should return true if the scheduler would like to
preempt the current job.

job remove() returns the job that
the scheduler would like to run next
(and removes it from the queue) 

boolean reschedule(int timeleft) returns
true if
there is a reason to stop the current process and start another.  it is
called by mainloop on a clock interrupt and is essential to implementing
preemption.  if
it returns true, the mainloop will take the current running process off
the cpu and return it to the cpu queue (by calling add) and then
ask for another job to run by calling remove.
as in add, the timeleft parameter is the amount of cpu
time remaining in the current burst of the currently running job (-1 if
no job is running).


you may also need to look at the job class.  one useful
job method is:

int nextburst() which returns the burst time
remaining


experiments

compare the performance of the four scheduling algorithms.
also compare the performance for various values of the parameters:
quantum for rr and a for psjf). note that if quantum
is very large, rr becomes first-come-first-served (fcfs) and if
quantum==1 , rr approximates processor-sharing (ps).


compare the behavior and performance of each of the policies. discover
the strengths and weaknesses of each of them. compare the performance results
you observe with the predictions discussed in class and in the book. you
must supply quantitative data to support your conclusions. 

you should approach this portion of the assignment as you would approach
a laboratory assignment in a physics course. use the ``scientific method.''
you should have some hypotheses that you confirm or reject based on behaviors
observed during well-planned, organized experimentation. give careful thought
to the correct choice of parameters for the programs. try a few trial runs
with various parameters, print out the results, and go home and think about
the results. these preliminary results should help you decide on better
parameters for a second round of trials. remember: it's not the quantity
but the quality of data that dictates the quality of the experiments. 

if the program is not printing out all the statistics you would like
to see, feel free to modify it to produce better output. you may find additional
statistics-reporting code can help explain some of the behavior you observe.


report

you are to prepare a report describing the results of your experiments.
again, approach this report as you would approach a physics laboratory
experiment report. you should carefully describe what experiments you did
and what the results showed you about the different scheduling policies.
we want to see a correlation between the experiments you run and the conclusions
you draw. you must supply quantitative data to support your conclusions.
the report should be not more than three typewritten pages, excluding
tables, graphs, etc. 

grading

you grade will be determined as follows: 


60% - report (experiments, conclusions, presentation) 

40% - implementation (correctness, style, documentation) 


you must work in two-person groups for this project. 


handing in 

you should bring your report
and all of the .java
files you modified (with your additions clearly detailed in your
code or in a separate file) to class on the day the project is due. you should
also create four directories in your hand-in folder -- one for each of your
scheduler versions.  into each directory you should place a 
copy 
of the files needed to run that particular scheduler
(.java files, trace
file) as well as a redirected copy of the output from one execution.
a short readme file containing the names of you and your partner
can just be placed in your hand-in folder. 
the hand-in directories
for project 3 can be found at: 


~cs537-1/public/handin/project3



as always, points will be deducted for code that fails to satisfy the
minimal criteria for comments and structure specified in the hand-in directions
for project 2.

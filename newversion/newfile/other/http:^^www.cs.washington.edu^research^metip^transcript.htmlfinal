the transcript project is an effort to create a framework in which
a new generation of software for computer-assisted instruction
can access and contribute to personal data repositories of
information related to educational assessment and educational planning.
goals include facilitation of effective distance learning
and the enabling of computer-based educational planning
in a context of diverse student needs, diverse student backgrounds,
and a rich variety of educational opportunities provided over the network.


the purpose of the transcript core record is to present an overview of the
student's background in a fixed-size file.  this size is set small enough to
fit on a pc style floppy diskette.


additionally we are developing a network-based tutorial system using
transcript.  this would allow students to complete a tutorial over the network
and have the results of their studies stored in their personal transcript
record.  


some of the components of the transcript core record include:


 personal information
 academic acheivement in transcript subjects
 preferred learning style
 history of the transcript record
 history and summary of education goals
 directory of supplemental transcript records



the transcript supports 
 education through the internet.

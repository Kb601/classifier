will the real jeff lampert please stand up?


on the left is oct 94, on the right is may 96. i may add a clean shaven/
goatee comparison, too, since i seem to let it grow for a week or two
and then shave it off, just to confuse people (and occasionally just shave
one side, although i haven't done that since halloween ;) ). speaking of
which jeff, at the bottom will soon feature something designed for me as a prank over
spring break a few years back...the culprits set that up as my start-up
screen and turned my monitor upside-down, but i'm not going to mention
names, mika and maura...oopsie ;);)

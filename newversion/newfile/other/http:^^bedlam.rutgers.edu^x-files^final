if you liked those, perhaps you'll like our gallery of x-files audio
snippets, with much thanks to patrick ryan for the original
digitization.

this way to:

the frequently asked questions file, (aka the x-files x-file, maintained by pat gonzales (gonza006@maroon.tc.umn.edu.)
the x-files episode guide, maintained by cliff k. chen (cliff@eniac.seas.upenn.edu) is really quite excellent.

at last! warner brothers is set to release the mark snow
x-files soundtrack: "the
truth and the light" on october 8, 1996.  hurrah!!!  although the
web page doesn't include sound-bites (like "key of x's" does), it does
include an nice bit of biography about mr. snow, track information
about the disk itself, and the hugest list of x-files web sites i've
ever seen. 


this way to warner brother's sample-filled(!) page for their
release (march 26, 1996) of the songs in the key of x.
as you have probably heard, this disc will have mark snow's theme
song, and then the rest will be non-x-soundtrack music done by various
artists, who were inspired by the show (ok, so nick cave's "red right
hand" is in there too.) that cover gives me the willies!  audio samples
of excellent quality.

cliff also maintains the x-files 20 questions.  read before posting to x-files newsgroups!
the 'deep background' frequently asked questions file, maintained by jeff gostin (jgostin@eternal.pha.pa.us.)
pat gonzales also keeps up the 'creative' groups' faq for prospective fanfictioneres.


try out the (very impressive) entertainment weekly article
 
"the x-files exposed" by dana kennedy, with photographs by 
william mercer.  (also try out the other ew stuff - this
is what the web will become!)  note, however, that you will have
to register - at no charge - with their service. this will allow
them to tailor future services to the needs people like you (i guess. :-)
try hans larsen's 
norwegian x-files site.  very impressive graphical interface!
another extremely impressive site is the 

web page of the aol x-files forum.  a high-energy group of fans!
an x-files ftp area, maintained by cort@cs.nmt.edu (this one has been a little iffy of late.)
a link to liem bahneman's x-files www server. (warning: the link to this site seems to be very slow.)
another ftp area, including gif's, and audio.  (this in an australian site.)
here's danny
sanders' x-files page includes audio "mulderisms", faq's, and more!
jen "scully" linville's x-files page includes a ton of x-files stuff, including net-interviews, quotations, and more.
the cast.
some sound-bites from the show, provided by terence higgins (thig@csd4.csd.uwm.edu).
kymberlee ricke's "netpicker's guide" to the x-files.  filled interesting "how come..." questions.  warning!  reading this may cause you to begin watching shows far too many times to find these things! :-)
a review of the x-files from the magazine 
millenium pop.
information about the unofficial (but original) x-files fan club.
results of the internet x-files viewer survey (that is, viewers describe themselves.)

a collection of fan art (if you have something, send a uuencoded version of it to x-files@www.rutgers.edu).
an x-files title collage. (many images - takes a while to download!)

here's a link to the blessed-by-tcffc "official" web page, which used
to be at delphi and now appears to be moved to this new location.
(the word "official", as any advertising droid will tell you, is used
to leverage (they love that word) profits.)  they've done a
very nice job with this page.

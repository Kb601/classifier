 by acting as an intelligent personal assistant, the softbot
supports a qualitatively different kind of human-computer interface.
a person can make a high level request, and the softbot uses search,
inference, and knowledge to satisfy the request.  furthermore, the
softbot is able to tolerate and recover from ambiguity, omissions, and
errors in human requests.


 the softbot is able to communicate
with its user through a graphical user interface, an e-mail interface,
and eventually a natural language interface.  through any of the user
interfaces, the user provides the softbot with simple statements of
complex goals.


you can walk through an example interaction with the
softbot gui.








the gui was designed by   aaron pulkka         and oren
etzioni, and implemented  by aaron and rob spiger.

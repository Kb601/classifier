     introduction  

the purpose of this assignment is to introduce you to java programming.  
you are to implement a simple shell (command interpreter) that behaves 
similarly to the unix shell. when you type in a command (in response to 
its prompt), it will create a thread that will execute the command you 
entered.  multiple commands can be chained together on a single line,
separated by `&amp;' (ampersand) characters.  your shell will create a
thread for each individual command and prompt for more
user input when they have all finished.

unlike the real shell, your program only has to deal with a handful of
``built-in'' commands:


     cat file ...
     print the contents of the named files to system.out one
    after the other.

     cmp file1 file2
     check whether the two files have identical contents and print an
    appropriate message to system.out.

     sort file
     print the lines of file in sorted (lexicographic) order.

     exit
     terminate the program.  you should also terminate on reaching
    end-of-file on system.in.

you needn't implement 
pipes or re-direction of standard input and standard output, but you 
must be able to handle an arbitrary number of commands per line -- 
each with an arbitrary number of arguments separated by arbitrary 
amounts of white space (blanks or tabs) (although only cat
takes more than two arguments).

  suggestions  

your public static void main() procedure in your primary class
will be quite simple.  it will be an infinite loop that prints a prompt, reads
a line (in other courses, a program with an infinite loop is considered a bad
thing, but in operating systems, it's the norm!),
parses it (breaks it up into its constituent commands),
starts a new thread to handle each of the different commands,
and then waits for all the threads to finish before printing the next prompt.

 scanning  

for scanning, you may find it easier to read the entire line into a string
object.  the

system.in 
object is of type

inputstream, 
so it can read either single bytes or arrays of bytes.
you could represent an input line as an array of bytes, but you will find
it much easier to use a

string 
instead.  you may want to look into the class

datainputstream 
to figure out how to read a line into a string.
tokenizing a string is made almost trivial using the

stringtokenizer 
class found in

java.util .

 commands  

for the cat command, you should look at the class  fileinputstream
 to see how to read data from a file.  cmp will be similar to cat,
but this time the contents of the two files will be compared.  for sort,
an efficient sorting algorithm is not required; anything that works is ok.
you might want to adapt the insertion sort used to introduce java in
the discussion sections.
some of the classes that might help you here are the  datainputstream
 class and the 
vector  class.

 using threads  

your primary class will read a command from a user and then will create a
thread to carry out the command.  it will then wait until the thread has
finished before continuing its own execution.  there are two ways to start
threads in java.  the first is to derive your class from the  thread  class and
then override its run() function (see pp. 161-162 in  the text).  the second is to use the  runnable 
interface (pp. 177-178).  here you create a class that implements this
interface.  you then pass a reference to this class into the constructor of a
new thread object.  the former is perhaps easier to understand
conceptually but the latter is more general.  you may choose
either method for this assignment.

 exceptions  

java requires you to place within a try block any methods that might
cause an exception.  following the try block is a catch clause
(or catch clauses) that will
be used to catch any exceptions that have been thrown (see chapter 7 for more
details on the syntax of these statements).  your code should deal with
exceptions in an appropriate manner.  for example, exceptions such as
attempting to open a file that does not exist should 
result in a message to the user and the continuation of the program.  
more serious exceptions may require an error message followed by program 
termination (using

system.exit()).

 grading  

hand in your source program and a transcript of a terminal session which demonstrates your shell's ability 
to perform as specified (see script(1)).  be sure that you use test data adequate to exercise 
your program's capabilities.  you should follow all the principles of software engineering you learned in 
cs 302 and cs 367, including top-down design, good indentation, meaningful variable names, modularity, 
and helpful comments.  you will be graded not only on the basis of correctness, but also programming
style and completeness of test data.

     other stuff  

for those of you writing your programs on the solaris machines, you might consider using
a makefile to aid in compilation.  those of you using dos may want to look into doskey, 
a little program that provides for easy command manipulation.  feel free to send any other
work-saving methods you find to

the ta, and he will distribute them to the class.

getting started

the most common java programs are applications and applets.
applications are standalone programs,
such as the hotjava browser.
applets are similar to applications,
but they don't run standalone. 
instead, applets adhere to a set of conventions
that lets them run within a java-compatible browser.
if you're using a browser that can view applets,
you should see an animation just below this paragraph --
that's an applet embedded in this html page.



        
        
        
        







    
        
    
    
        the "hello world" application --
        start here if you want to create standalone java applications.
    





    
        
    
    
        the "hello world" applet --
        start here if you are interested in writing applets only.
    






what next?

now that you've seen how to write a java program,
you can proceed with any of the topics below.





    
	
    
    
	writing java programs --
	these lessons discuss techniques and concepts
	that any java programmer can use.
	the book version of this tutorial breaks this trail in two:
	
	
	writing java programs,
	which contains the first three lessons shown on the index page

	custom networking and security --
	the lessons on this trail
	teach you how to connect your applications and applets

click on a tile next to the blank space to move it.


history:


2/3/96 -- added custom update method to make redrawing of the puzzle
iteself happen offscreen to get rid of occasional flicker.


2/2/96 -- the randomize button now works, and the repeat last button
currently puts the puzzle back in order.  that will change.


1/29/96 -- note that although buttons now appear for the
aforementioned functions, they don't actually do anything yet.  oh
well, at least i figured out layouts.


1/25/96 -- first put up.  much more is coming, including a randomize
button an a couple of ai search algorithms to automatically solve the puzzle.

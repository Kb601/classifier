the  computer vision laboratory
 of the  department of computer
science at columbia university 
introduces omnicam, a video camera that can &quot;see&quot; 
in all directions.

the optics of the sensor has been designed to ensure that all points in
the world are projected through a single center of projection. this allows
the omnivideo software to generate pure perspective images at video
rate for any user-selected viewing direction and magnification.




	




come to the entrance of the computer science department at 450 mudd
hall to interact with omnicam and omnivideo!

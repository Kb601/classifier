cse/engr 142: not computer programming i


you can definitely expect this page to change as we bump into other
interesting stuff.  enjoy!  (no, we won't have too much of this stuff on
the final...)


this is a great link to a bunch of other links:

the whole internet catalog.
also of interest is the collection of wonderful - to - wacky
(check out the strawberry pop-tart blowtorch page!)
web links collected by our own department chair 
ed lazowska.
the  official university of washington 
homepage is a great place to check out the view of mount rainier that you
are missing.

the arts

   movie listings and reviews! forget spending 35 cents to
    check what's playing.  click 
    here;
    provided by uspan, the us performing
    arts network or some such.  they also give schedules and reviews of
    other events in the seattle area -- theater, music clubs, etc.
  
    the internet movie database.
   seattle area book stores.
  
    shakespeare: complete works
   have not had time to go to a museum lately?  well, if you are
    going to see any why not go to a really good one, like

the gastronomic arts

  no more hub food?  here is a
    seattle restaurant
    guide. 
   this is not a link but a hint.  if you were looking for a nice
    place to have coffee on the uw campus, where would you go?  your tas
    have been known to occasionally visit the burke museum cafe which is
    on the burke museum (near the corner of 15th and 45th), and the
    coffee-shop in the basement of the art department (one of the two
    buildings on the north end of the quad).  now if you wanted other
    places to have coffee you could look at 
    a guide
    to seattle coffee which strangely enough is edited in
    philadelphia...

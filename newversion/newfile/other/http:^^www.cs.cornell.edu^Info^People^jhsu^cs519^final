financial transactions would have the following needs:
security on an unsecure network.
gut reaction would be that for any sort of financial transactions, data
encryption and user authetication are the first and foremost concerns.
on user authentication, adequate encryption would presumably allow for less
robust authetication.  otherwise, an s/key or snk (like they use for cs
firewall) are definitely necessary due to the lack of security in the data
transmission.

fault-tolerant systems
transactions can not be halted because one server is down. 
we need to make sure that transaction reports to the banks or whatever
central database we are using filter out duplicates and all the standard
mutual exclusion things so that transactions aren't missed.

guaranteed response time
or something resembling a guaranteed response time on an ip network.
having to wait 2-3 minutes for a transaction or having your packets
dropped and timedout won't cut it for electronic commerce.

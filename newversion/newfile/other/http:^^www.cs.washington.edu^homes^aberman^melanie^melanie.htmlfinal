hi.  i was born on may 24, 1996. here are some pictures of me!

here i am, asleep in my crib, just 3 days old.  jessica rupp made me
a nice blanket which i'm wrapped in right now.  gramma 
made me that cute hat i'm wearing. unfortunately, mommy and daddy then
put me in my crib, which, as you can see, totally clashes with my pretty
blanket and hat.  i guess fashion sense skips a generation.


this is a day later.  they've put me on their bed and dressed me
in tweety bird. that's 
gramma's arm in the foreground.

here's a picture of mommy and daddy and me together.  

i'm one week old today!  i celebrated by sleeping. my great grandma 
made that nice blanket for me.

here i am at my brit-bat.  i'm the one sleeping.
auntie lisa was nice enough to lend me her shoulder for a while.



here i am at 5 weeks.  aren't i angelic?

i got some professional photos done at seven
weeks.  here's one of them.

another picture of moi, jus hanging out.
this one was at 2 months.

mommy and daddy and i went to victoria for their 5th wedding anniversary.
here's a picture of us at the buschart gardens

here i am trying to get up.  it's not working. you can see one of
custard's paws to my right.  he just lays around a lot.

mommy goes to this group where lots of mothers gather around with their
babies.  here's a picture of us (the babies, not the mommies):

 interdependent particle systems 
  by justin a. mccune  

 1.0 introduction  
particle systems have been used to model a variety of "fuzzy" objects
such as water, fire, grass, fireworks, clouds, smoke, and others.  in
no work that i am aware of do the particles within the system interact
with each other.  instead to simulate the realities which they model,
the designers of the particle-system use specific starting configurations,
groups of particle systems, and introduce torques, spirals, and other
effects to the particle system(s).  sometimes to simulate waterfalls and
other fuzzy objects where collisions are necessary, the particles are
checked for collision against a small number of external objects and
are bounced off of the objects with which they collide. independent
particle systems therefore, do not experience pressure gradients, do
not collide with particles within their own system, and only approximate
the reality which they represent.

the results
reported within this paper report on particle-systems that do interact
with their neighboring particles. the motivation behind this research
is an attempt to allow the interaction
of two or more particle systems and to more produce a more realistic
model of particle systems.

	section 2 reviews the principles of independent particle systems,
section 3 presents the problems and methods used in this research, section
4 discusses the results, section 5 presents the conclusion and possible
extensions, while section 6 presents the references. 

 2.0 a review of independent particle systems 

	particle systems can usually be characterized by the following
properties:

	a lifetime
	a velocity
	a color 
	a transparency
	a size
	a shape
	
	almost all particles have a lifetime,velocity, and color where
the remaining properties are decided upon by the modeller. 
over the lifetime of
the particle, the particle will change some or all of its attributes- the
color might fade from white to red before it "dies". velocities of
particles can increase, decrease, or alter directions due to gravity 
or a collision with some object. 

	the other characteristic of particle systems is that there are a 
large number of particles.  water is technically comprised of billions and
billions of h2o molecules, and a particle system likewise represents what
it models with many many particles, though not billions and billions.  
the typical particle system is comprised of thousands of particles where
this could range from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands depending
upon the resolution needed and the size of the desired image. 

particle systems are used to model "fuzzy" objects, such as fire, water,
and other dynamic systems that are difficult to model with conventional
methods, mainly due to the wide variations in color and shape even for
just one moment in time.  to provide a well known example of a particle
system take a look at the "genesis effect" in star trek ii: the wrath of kahn.  
a particle system is used to model first an explosion and then the spreading
of a fire around a planet.  the genesis effect used 25-750+ thousand particles 
throughout the course of the animation.


 3.0 interdependent particle systems 

in an interdependent particle system, particles can change based on
the presence, number, and/or proximity of neighboring particles.  in
real systems comprised of molecules, large densities tend to disperse
until equilibrium is reached.  molecules also exchange energy, and that
energy can directly affect the color of the light that the molecule
emits or reflects.  with an interdependent particle system, it becomes
possible to simulate these effects.  for instance, take a fire particle
system and a water particle system and mix parts of the systems together-
the result is steam.  an interdependent system of fire and water interacting
to produce steam was the goal and motivation of this research. 

the obvious and most difficult problem when dealing with an 
interactive particle system is the large number of particles.
to determine collision, engergy exchange, or other interactive effects
on any particle x, the particle either must search or sum the effects
of all its neihgboring n-1 particles.  the problem as most simply
and correctly formulated is n squared in complexity.
with a hundred thousand particles, however, moving and changing n
squared particles per frame of an animation will take too long.
a simplification
is needed to make the system develop more quickly and is easily justified
and arrived at when examining real systems. 

in all systems we are concerned with, a particle's dependency on its 
neighbors is usually
proportional to or less than the inverse square of the distance between
it and the neighbor.  with thousands of particles within a
system, it is likely that much less than a hundred particles
will actually contribute significantly to the motion or energy level
of any particle.  thus, there is but to determine what a "significant"
contribution is, the distance where the average particle's contribution
will be less than significant, and which particles are within that distance.


the problem is simplified, but to determine which particles are within
the distance without any other information than given by the particles
themselves would still be an n squared operation.  therefore, it is 
logical to introduce into the model, the concept of bins.  space is
divided into regularly spaced equal volume bins.  each particle is 
put into the bin corresponding to its location in space.  thus, there
are two large lists - one a list of all the particles, and the other 
an arranged set of bins containing pointers to the appropriate particle.

ideally each bin would in any dimension be at least the size of the
distance whereby a particle is judged to possibly have a significant
contribution.  to determine the contributions of the neighbors to particle x,
the program would need  to search only the other particles within the bin 
that particle x is in and all the particles within the immediately 
neighboring bins --to deal with particles located near the boundaries of a bin.
since all particles within the threshold distance are guaranteed to be within
the space searched, particle x is guaranteed to be modified by all significant
contributors.

though this would work, it is impractical to implement due to memory
limitations.  the ideal bin size would generally be only three to four
times the size of a particle.  however to account for all the places a
particle might move to during the progression of its life, there will be a large
percentage of bins that most of the time are empty.
given this and the fact that there are 3 dimensions which must have bins
allocated, result in very large numbers of bins.  for instance,
taking a hundred bins per each dimension, results in the need for a million
bins- more bins than particles.  a hundred bins, would also be inefficient
for many parts of the particle system where there were large densities of
particles-- again the lists to be searched would be in the hundreds per
particle negating the effectiveness of using bins.  
therefore, a larger number of bins is necessary, but using more bins would
quickly exhaust the resources of almost any computer. 

to solve this problem we must simplify the model even further losing much
of the accuracy that could be obtained with the previous methods.  each bin
is now allowed to hold only a number of particles, a temperature,or some other
most important data element.  instead
of containing a variable size list of particles within the bin, 
it contains a set small number of informational elements.  
this results in the loss of alot of useful information and will
result in rough approximations that
lose the accuracy of earlier models.  however, interdependent reactions
are still possible, because there is some information available about any 
particle's local
region of space and its immediately neighboring areas of space. 

the problem is transformed from one of searching through thousands of particles
to one of communication and/or accuracy.  
by containing only such simple information, spatial
relation is lost, as well as specific data, and most importantly identity.
simulation of collisions, movement, and temperature exchange is  now possible
only as probabilities and is no longer deterministic. 

for example, to determine the collision of a particle x moving through space
with another particle, we must bound the maximum number of particles in any
given region of space.  if particle x is attempting to move through a bin,
then collision occurs with a probablility equal to the 
number of particles within the bin
divided by the maximum number of particles allowed in the bin.  for example,
if the maximum number of particles per bin is 30, and there are 19 particles
in the bin that particle x is attempting to move through, then there is a 
2/3rds chance that particle x will collide. 

the communication issue is also a problem that must be resolved.  in 
the efforts to research fire and water combining to form steam, the appropriate
physical model is each particle exchanges temperatures and sometimes steam
is created and/or sometimes the fire is extinguished.  since the identity
of any particle within a bin is lost, a particle that moves from a bin to
another bin where it should change state and likewise decrement the opposing
particles' states will not have any specific particle with which to interact.
therefore, some means of communicating the change of state is necessary. 
for example, consider a water particle moving into a bin full of fire-particles.with all the surrounding fire particles, the water particle(s) should
transform to steam.  but the fire particles should have their temperatures
altered as well, or should have some proportion of fire particles die to
account for the energy exchanged.

the bins therefore must be utilized to pass messages to particles that should
die or undergo a loss in energy.  one set of particles is choosen to perform
the transition and issue the appropriate message, the other is choosen to 
listen for the message and take the appropriate action.  in the fire and
water example, the water is the one which performs the tansition to steam
and passes the message, while the fire particles are the system that reacts
to the passed messages. 

one possible means of message passing and the one utilized in this research
is to use the number of particles per bin as the means of message passing.
temperature of given particles and motion vectors can be calculated based
on these figures.  to differentiate water from fire, water is given a 
negative count.  where it is obvious that two types of particles are 
present in a certain bin, it is assumed that fire extinguishes water with
a certain ratio of fire particles to water particles.  if the water particles
transform, they decrement the number of particle bins by the number of
fire particles extinguished.  before the fire-particles move again they
note the change and that percentage of particles will on average die. 

for example, take particle x.  it moves into a bin and after all other
fire particles have moved it notes that there are 15 particles
including itself in the bin.  during the water movement portion of the frame,
3 water particles move into the same bin and are considered to exchange heat
and vaporize with the fire particles.  say that it takes two fire particles
to vaporize one water particle, then 6 fire particles are extinguished, while
3 new steam particles are created.  the final bin count is 9-- steam is counted
as a neutral particle.  the final position of all particles in the frame
is output and processing for the next frame begins.  each fire-particle is
searched for those particles that should have died.  when particle x is
reached (or any of the fire particles in the bin) it notes that there are
now 9 particles in the bin when their used to be 15.  thus, 6 out of the 15
particles must have died.  the particle picks a random number between 0 and 1
and if it's number is less than 6/15ths, it's number is up and 
the particle "dies."

it can happen the opposite way as well, that a fire-particle moves into a bin
populated by water particles and should extinguish itself as well.  the water
particles also need to know their state after all water particles have moved,
so that they will also be killed off in the appropriate situtation.

a byproduct of the fact that probabilities are used to kill of particles, is
that the bin counts are accurate only on the average.  as time passes however,
local error and changes in the system based on the error could accumulate.
therefore it is necessary to recount the number of particles of any type at
the end of each movement phase.  this in some ways doubles the time required
to animate any interacting particle system, but is still linear in time and
better than n squared.

thus, the steps required to interact 2 particle systems with message passing
can be generalized as follows:


	remove "dead" particles of type 1 from the particle system
	move the type 1 particles
	after all type 1 particles have moved, each type 1 particle notes final state
	remove "dead" particles of type 2 from the particle system
    move the type 2 particles
	after all type 2 particles have moved, each type 2 particle notes final state


 4.0 results 

	though the above presented method solves many problems, there are
a few that are more difficult to side-step.  in particular, conservation of
momentum is difficult to maintain- simulating a collision is easily done 
using a probabilistic method and in closely approximating reality  should
be done through every bin which the particle moves.  however, when a collision
occurs the only particle that can be affected (unless message passing is
again used) is the source particle.  
	this problem encountered during the research can either be side-stepped
by ignoring interim bins completely (as is done in this research) or perhaps
can have a damping factor applied proportionate to the number of collisions
that might have occurred.  

	another difficulty is that there are even more parameters that must
be tweaked into place to produce an image that approximates the reality and
doesn't approximate some alterante reality-- where flames progress upwards
in very defined bands for instance. 

	an implementation of an interdependent fire system was investigated
and can be seen by the results below.  the fire particle system image 
was originally created with a 200,000 particle-system. 
attempted to use 150,000 particles in the provided mpeg.
the particles are created during frames 1-30 and
after that are created from the particles that have already died. 
the image was rendered using  
dx  with a color map and an opacity map. the animation took approximately
11 minutes to create running on a risc 6000 processor with 128 mb of memory. 
however, it has been noticed that due to the bin
limitations many of the particles go unused and essentially only slightly
more than 50,000 particles are being used.  using only 50,000 particles 
(due to the current initialization sequence of the program) a slightly
less full animation is produced, but is comparable to the original and
only takes 5.4 minutes to create.  

in the provided animation,
a particle's temperature is based on the number of particles
within the same region of space, while it's motion vector is determined
based upon the density of particles immediately within its own space as
well as those bins that immediately neighbor the space.  a damping factor
is applied to the motion in the plane that produces a circular cross-section
when no particles are collided, whereas in the vertical direction changes
in motion are based on temperature.  overall, there are 21 parameters including
bin sizes that may be modified. it is also important to note, 
that if the bin size is selected to be too large, visible artifacts will
be generated.

    
 
the animation is also present as an  mpeg.  

there are some artifacts present in the animation of the flame that i am
not quite yet sure why they are there.  in the first frame of the animation
provided, a top view is provided.  it is possible to see from this top view
a criss-cross pattern that is an obvious artifact from using the bins and/or
some combination of the motion mechanism, although i am unsure as to why
this is the case.  also, the flame tends to pulse from one frame to the next
which is something that would preferably not occur- i am unsure
what is causing the oscillatory motion. 


there is another benefit to using bins with an interdependent particle systems,
parallelization.  as opposed to passing particles and all their associated 
information across bin boundaries, only the information contained by the
bins need be passed.  this can save (given the amount of information each
particle must pass as well as the fact that there can be a good number
of particles per bin) up to more than 100 times the amount of message passing
that needs to be done.  thus, it should be possible to parallelize the
application. 

one other effect should be noted.  in independent particle systems, groups
of particle systems can be lessened or local processing abandoned altogether
once sufficient information for a given area of the output area has been 
determined
(e.g. there is no reason to use a thousand particles to represent a section
of the screen only 10 pixels by 10 pixels wide).  in an interdependent particle
systems, this is not the case.  the entire process of the particle system is
dependent upon the presence and number of its nearest neighbors-- stopping
part of the particle system will eventually translate its effects to neighboring
parts of the particle system that are still moving, with unknown consequences.
thus, some of the optimizations that are possible for independent systems,
are not necessarily possible with interdependent particle systems.  

 5.0 conclusions	

	this work has demonstrated that an interdependent particle system 
approach is feasible and that it is possible to use some of the attributes
of the particle system itself to model "fuzzy" objects.  a model has been
proposed to allow the interaction of two particle systems and could possibly
be extended to more.  many aspects of this work remain unexplored. future work 
will finish the investigation of the proposed model
to interact two particle systems to result in a third.   

	there are many aspects of interdependent particle systems where
	research could still be done.  for instance, 
investigating the interactions used on independent systems to achieve the
flickering of a flame by adding spirals or clustering particles.  or trying
to simulate these effects by adding an air particle system to
the field to simulate the convection of air.  starting
configurations that change over time and are not based on some random 
distribution of some preset starting configuration, but perhaps based on
preset data volumes.   it would also be interesting to see the results
of a wall of fire, or some other configuration of flames modeled on a
parallel processor.

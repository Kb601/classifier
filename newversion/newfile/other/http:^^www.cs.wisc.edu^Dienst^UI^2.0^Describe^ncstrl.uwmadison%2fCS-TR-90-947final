 given an arbitrary program dependence graph, the algorithm reconstituteprogram determines whether the graph is \fifeasible\fp (\fii.e.\fp, is the dependence graph of some program), and if so produces such a program. reconstituteprogram is currently used for program integration, and has the potential to be used by other algorithms that manipulate program dependence graphs. this paper corrects a minor error that was in the original definition of reconstituteprogram, and proves that the new version of the algorithm is correct.

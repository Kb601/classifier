work and interests 


my work, my job, my interests

my current academic interests lie in databases, networks and operating systems.
i am presently working with prof. miron
livny and prof. raghu ramakrishnan on the devise
project. devise is a visualization tool with a visual query interface. 

earlier i was working  for the reef project which involved work using  
condor, 
pvm and  
coral. this was an attempt at 
executing coral queries on a cluster of workstations, in this case the 
condor pool at the university of wisconsin-madison. a report of the same will appear here when time permits. 

this was done as part of the c.o.d. project as a summer research project.



 past work
 in the summer of 1994 i worked for 3 months as a summer intern at india's
leading research institute, bhabha atomic research center. here i worked on
building an mpi interface for the anupam parallel machine.
 during my undergraduate study, i was interested in 
automatic verification of protocols, finite automata based verification of systems, statecharts and binary decision diagrams. 
 i was also remotely interested in compilers and architecture.

cs 304p: computer science i: syllabus


cs 304p is an introduction to computer science and programming for
students with no previous university cs coursework.

this section of cs 304p will use the programming language scheme, a
dialect of lisp.  the scheme implementation we will use is called
gambit and runs on macintosh computers.  toward the end of the
semester, we will quickly learn pascal for compatibility with later
cs classes.

this course is intended to move faster than the regular cs 304p course
and to emphasize cs concepts more than programming language syntax.
we will do more programming and probably work harder than the regular
cs 304p course, and we will hopefully learn more and have more fun.

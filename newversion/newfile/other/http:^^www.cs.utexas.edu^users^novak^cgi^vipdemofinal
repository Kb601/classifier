vip demo
programming and problem solving by connecting diagrams

this is a demonstration of the vip (view interactive programming) program.
vip allows the user to create scientific programs or to solve physics
problems by connecting diagrams that represent physical and
mathematical principles.  the following example shows a specification
for calculating the mass of the sun, following newton's reasoning,
by equating the gravitational attraction of the sun on the earth with
the force required to keep the earth in circular motion.



when the program is started, a window is created with a command menu
and input and output areas.  use the command output language to select
the desired language for the program that is created.  (the actual
program will be served to you in a file that is presented after the
demo program is terminated.)  use the input lines to specify the name
and type of each input variable, one per line, in the format shown.
examples are (radius integer) and
(speed (units real mph)).
then select the command new program to start vip.

a vip program is created by connecting diagram boxes that represent
variables and physical and mathematical principles.  a connection
signifies that two quantities are equal.  to make a connection,
click the mouse, once for each end of the connection, on variable boxes
or on "buttons" associated with diagrams.  to get a useful program, there
must be a connection to the output box.

the vip commands are as follows:

 done         finished; make a program from the diagram.
 redo         start over.
 move         move a box.  click the box you wish to move.
 delete       delete a box or a connection.
 geometry     select a new geometric principle box.
 physics      select a new physical principle box.
 make var     make a local variable.
 specify type specify the type of a variable.
        this can also be used to specify units.
 op           make an operation box, such as
                               + - * /.
 type-in      type in a numeric constant, with units if
                               desired.
 constant     select a predefined constant,
        such as the speed of light.



instructions


	you must be logged in to a host running x windows.
	type   xhost + www.cs.utexas.edu   (exactly as shown
        at left) in a window on that host
	to allow this server to write to your display.
	enter your x display name here if needed; you may need to change
        what is shown in the box to your x display name.  for example,
         myterminal.cs.utexas.edu:0.0  
	
	click  to start the demo.

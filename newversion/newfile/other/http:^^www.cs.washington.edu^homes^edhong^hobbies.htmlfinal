eddie hong's hobbies 



 ed's hobbies 

in the outdoor activity/sports area, i like swimming, ultimate, soccer,
 basketball, hiking, sailing, roller-blading, biking,
running, rock-climbing, skiing, white-water river rafting,
and probably many others that
i have just neglected to mention.  

currently, my favorite sport is ultimate frisbee- it's very good exercise
when you run around a lot, and its also a competitive team effort.  

in the sports area, i like to try new things. i will eventually try
bungee jumping, and maybe even sky-diving, although sky-diving is really
expensive (i think). also, just because i like things, it doesn't mean
i do them often. for example, i've only gone rock-climbing and white-water
river rafting once each. and i only joined the sailing club at the uw 
this summer, and i just learned how to sail.

 

other things i like to do include playing computer games (escape velocity
for the macintosh by ambrosia software is what i'm currently playing),
playing cards, and playing piano and cello.
 

here are some pictures of my first (and last) river rafting trip:

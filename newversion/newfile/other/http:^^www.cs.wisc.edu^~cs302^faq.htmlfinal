cs 302 frequently asked questions (faq)

this faq came about because of problems that many students were encountering.
it is not comprehensive, and it will probably be constantly evolving.
it is grouped by which language is being used, and there is a list of non-
language-specific problems at the end.  if you don't find what you want here,
ask a consultant.  if you are a consultant, you can e-mail me at

  c++ common problems:  using the borland ide and the c++ language 


  compiler and linker errors  : when borland
refuses to run your program. 
  runtime errors : crashes, floating point errors,
protection faults -- errors that occur while your program is running. 
  borland ide problems : difficulties with your program
files or project files, windows, the screen editor.  in general, problems with the 
mechanics of using the borland ide. 
  input/output errors : problems with reading in input, 
sending output to files, etc. 
  it's just not working!!

  miscellaneous problems:  printing, e-mail, disk quotas... 




c++


 compiler and linker errors 


error: statement missing ; 
 
 

fix: click on this message, and will get the highlighted line in your
source file. this line or the line immediately before it is not ended
with a ; (semicolon).  all lines of c code except statements
which can be followed by compound statements ( if ,
else, do, etc.) should have a ; to mark the end of the
statement.   
 


error: declaration syntax error



fix: if this line isn't declaring a variable, then the problem
is definitely that some variable declaration immediately before it is
missing a ; (semicolon).  otherwise, this may still be the problem,
but you may have also done something else like missed a , (comma) in
between variable names, or put a space in a variable name. (variables
must be one word)
 




error: unable to assign char* to char



fix: a char variable is a single keystroke like 's' or
'\n'. (note the single quotes) a char* variable is an array of
characters (a string) like "hello there!" (note the double quotes).
for beginner's purposes, view them as entirely different animals.  in
particular, 's' is not the same as "s".  ('s' takes up 1 byte of
memory whereas "s" is stored as a byte containing 's' followed by a
byte containing the end of string message.)





 the program seemed to be (nearly) working before, but now it gets all sorts of 	errors involving i/ostreams when i run it.   

it is linking the program without compiling the source code. 
click inside the .cpp window, and select project,compile.  then try running
it again.


why do i get that annoying "linker error in owlmain"?


chances are that you have not created/opened a project.  you must do this
through the project menu...you cannot do it through the file menu.  once you
have created/opened a project, make sure that you choose the build all option
under the project menu.  if you don't, chances are that you will get many more
linker errors.




my program source file has a ".c" extension and the borland compiler
complains when i attempt to compile it.  how do i make it a c++ file?


this is caused by forgetting to choose the "advanced" option when creating a
project file.  the easiest way to fix this problem is to select the source
code file name in the project window (you will know it is selected because it
will be highlighted).  press the right mouse button and a menu will pop up.
choose "edit node attributes" from this menu.  it will produce a window that
will allow you to change the default extension for the file...choose ".cpp".
if you have saved the program source file with the ".c" extension, you will 
want to resave the file with a ".cpp" extension.  use the "save as" option
under the "file" menu.





 run-time errors 


my program gives me some weird windows error message when i run it.
what can i do?


unfortunately, this is a very wide open problem and can be caused by numerous
things.  common problems are the following:  trying to use a pointer that
points to null, accessing elements beyond the bounds of an array, creating
large data structures (like 2-dimensional integer arrays) as local variables
to functions, running out of disk space, etc.  unfortunately, some of these
problems don't exhibit consistent behavior, but most times you can use the
interactive debugger to figure out what the problem is.




my program starts to run, but then it stops, and i get a
window that tells me "general protection exception".

this error is caused by access memory outside of legal bounds for your
program.  if often means you used an array, and tried to access or set
elements outside of the array bounds.  for instance, if you have an
array x[10], you may have asked for x[-2] or x[14].  another possible
cause for this error is that you are using pointers, and you attempted
to access a pointer that had not yet been initialized.  to find such an
error, it is often easiest to use the debugger to trace down the line of
code that causes the memory error.

  while the programming is running i get a "floating point
underflow" or "floating point:division by zero", and the program stops.  

a floating point underflow can be caused by uninitialized variables.  if
you declare some floats or doubles and don't set them to some value before
you use them, they may start out with huge or tiny values that cause errors
in calculations.  the simple fix is to initialize all your floats to zero. 

a division by zero error may not be obvious to look at the code, but can
occur when variables have unexpected values.  often you will be performing
some calculation inside a loop, and the loop goes one place too far or the
very first or very last iterations form special cases, resulting in a 
division by zero.  unless you can spot it right away, the best way to find
such an error is probably to use the debugger to track down the offending
line of code. then you can run the program again and
use the watch feature to view the variables involved, and see what causes
things to run afoul. 




 borland ide errors 


why do i see nothing when i open a project?


if you open an existing project and all you see is the background of the
borland ide, choose the project option under the view menu.  this will show
you the project window.




why is there nothing in my project window?


good question...could be an accidental thing or a fluke.  the way to fix this
is to select the target option under the project menu.  the easy thing to do
is to use the same name as the project (minus the .ide extension).  then you
go through the same process as creating a project.




when i try to open my program file (.cpp extension), i get some 
weird message about truncating lines.  what's up with that?


another good question...more than likely, you named your project with a ".cpp"
extension.  the default extension for a project file is ".ide" and should be
left this way.  unfortunately, it is questionable if you will be able to get
your source program back.  ask a consultant to attempt to salvage your code
from network backups.




my program source file has a ".c" extension and the borland compiler
complains when i attempt to compile it.  how do i make it a c++ file?


this is caused by forgetting to choose the "advanced" option when creating a
project file.  the easiest way to fix this problem is to select the source
code file name in the project window (you will know it is selected because it
will be highlighted).  press the right mouse button and a menu will pop up.
choose "edit node attributes" from this menu.  it will produce a window that
will allow you to change the default extension for the file...choose ".cpp".
if you have saved the program source file with the ".c" extension, you will 
want to resave the file with a ".cpp" extension.  use the "save as" option
under the "file" menu.




borland c++ always crashes when i attempt to run it.  how can i fix
this?



i would recommend that you ask a consultant to do this.  there are borland
configuration files that have apparently been corrupted.







 input/output errors 




i'm trying to do a "cin.getline", but it's not working.  when i
run the program, it just goes right by the getline as if it weren't there.

this is a very common problem.  there can be problems when you mix "cin >>"
and "cin.getline" input statements in a program.  the "cin >>" function will
take input, but it leaves a newline character in the input buffer.  if a
getline call follow a "cin >>", then the getline will read this single newline
character and stop.  it will appear as if the getline read nothing at all.
so whenever you have a getline following a "cin >>" you must clear the
newline character from the buffer either with a "cin.ignore" or another
"cin.getline".  this should, of course, be placed between the "cin >>" and
the "cin.getline" that really takes input.  here's an example that suffers
from this error: 

	cin >> golfscore;
	cin.getline( playername, max_str, '\n' );

in this case the playername would just get the null string because of the
newline character left in the input buffer by the "cin >>".  here are the
two ways to problem can be fixed.

	cin >> golfscore;
	cin.ignore( max_str, '\n' );
	cin.getline( playername, max_str, '\n' );

or

	cin >> golfscore;
	cin.getline( dummy_buffer, max_str, '\n' );
	cin.getline( playername, max_str, '\n' );



my program runs correctly and now i am redirecting the output to a 
file.  when i ran the program the first time, it worked great, but now when i 
run it i get the same output as the first time, no matter how i change the 
input.  what's the problem?


chance are that you still have the output file open from the first time you
ran the program.  windows basically will lock files that are in open windows
so that you cannot overwrite the contents of the file.  to remedy this, just
close the output file after you have printed it.  to find out if you do have
the output file open, choose the window menu.  it will tell you exactly what
you have open.




when i run my program and redirect the output to a file, the output
file is always empty.  why?


if you are also redirecting the input, you want to check to make sure that
you have the path name to the file typed in correctly.  if you have the path
name hard coded in your program, you want to make sure that you have used two
backslashes "\" for every one in your path.  for example, the following file
r:\public\jjason\myfile.in would be coded as follows in your program:

ifstream input("r:\\public\\jjason\\myfile.in");

also, make sure that if you copied the input file from an instructor, that you
copied to the correct directory.





  i'm trying to output with "cout", but a get a compiler error telling
me, "illegal structure operation."   

cout is used to print strings and numbers and such, but if you want to print
out some more complex object, you must use other means.  for instance, if
you have defined a class foo, you may have given it an output method
with prints some of its internal variables or other messages: 

class foo {
	...
	public:
	void output();
	...
};

when you want to print out such an object, students sometimes make the mistake
of making the call to the output member part of a cout: 

	foo fooa;

	cout 
the output function works on its own, and should not be a part of a cout.
despite the odd notation, "cout 
	cout 




 it's just not working!! 


if you're really having difficulties, remember that there are consultants
in the lab to help you most hours of the day.  they keep a "consultant" sign
on top of the computer at which they are working and wear nametags, so they
are easy to spot. 

my program doesn't give me the results i had hoped for.  or, my 
program runs, but it does some really strange things.  help!


your best bet is to run the interactive debugger.  consultants are also able
to help you, but chances are they will run the debugger themselves.  since
you are the one most familiar with your program, you would be the one most
likely to spot errors quickly using the debugger.  i recommend learning the
basic features of the debugger - stepping through a program and viewing the
contents of variables.









fortran

a little suggestion to make you more productive


when going through the program development cycle, it helps immensely if you
have two windows open with the ms-dos prompt.  in one window, you can use the 
editor to work on your program.  the other one you can leave at the dos prompt
so that you can compile and run the program.  this alleviates the need to
exit the editor every time you want to compile your program.  note:
make sure that you save your program in the editor before attempting to compile
it in the other window.






miscellaneous

i have run out of disk space.  how do i get more?


you will want to use the file manager to delete files from your user directory
(drive u:\).  first of all, don't delete the files that start with the 
letters "bc" as these are used by the borland c++ compiler.  likely candidates 
are files with the following extensions:  ".exe", ".obj", ".csm" and ".bak".  
these files are easy to reproduce.  a word of warning, only get rid of 
files that you know you created (or were created on your behalf, for instance by
compiling your program).  if you are not sure what you can delete, ask
a consultant.




i have been "locked out" of my account.  how do i gain access?



if you type your login password wrong enough times, you will be locked out of
the network for around 15 minutes.  you will have to wait until that time has
expired before you can log in again.




i get a message that i have "exceeded maximum logins" and i am
refused access.  how can i log in?



this is caused by you being logged in to more than one computer.  make sure
that you are not logged into any other machines...this includes machines in
other places in which you have logged into the computer science network.  also,
if you were working on a machine that crashed, and you immediately attempted
to log into another computer, you need to log into the machine that crashed
and log out before you can log into another machine.




i have been "locked out" of my email.  how do i gain access?



(from d. parter)  if you type your email password wrong enough times, kerberos 
locks the entry.  you should go to the systems lab (2350 cs&st) to get it
unlocked.




there are no free computers in the 1370 lab.  are there others we
can use? 


try the computers in the doit lab in the basement of the computer sciences
building.  there should be information outside of the 1370 lab on how to get
to the doit lab.




i send a job to the printer, but it never prints out.  what is
wrong?


there are two likely causes of this.  the first is that the print server is not
working.  the second is that you have exceeded your printer quota.  whatever
the problem, don't continue sending your files to the printer until you know
the cause of the problem.  use the check print queues program in the
administration group to view.  run this program and make sure all the laser
printers are selected (the box next to the printer names should have an 'x';
if not, click in the box and one will appear).  clicking the "check queues"
button will show you a list of all the printers, and the documents waiting
to be printed on each.  you can spot your print jobs because they are labelled
with your username.  if the queue are exceedingly long and not moving, inform
a consultant or the unix ta in 1359; there may be a problem with the printers.
the check print queues program also allows you to check your paper quota by
clicking on the "check quota" button.  if you have already printed as many 
pages as you are allowed, you must go to the computer systems lab in
2350, and pay for more paper to be credited to your account.





i would like to forward my cs e-mail to my student e-mail account.
is that possible?


of course.  you will want to use the user util program mentioned above.  after
you log in (using your login id and your e-mail password), from the menu you
can select to forward your e-mail.  just follow the directions...of course
this assumes that you have memorized your student e-mail address.  you can also
use this program to stop any forwarding of e-mail.




i have forwarded my e-mail and i would like to be able to check
it from the 1370 lab.  is that possible?


what you need to do is go into the e-mail program (eudora).  select the special
menu and from there, select the configuration option.  in the box labeled pop
account, type in the e-mail account which you would like to check.  this next
part is very important.  again select the special menu and
this time select the switches option.  make sure that the box marked "leave
mail on server" has an "x" in it.  if you don't have this box selected, when
you check your e-mail from the 1370 lab, it will download all of the mail in
the mailbox to your user directory.  this means that you will not be able to
check that e-mail from anywhere else.  trust me...i learned this one the hard
way.

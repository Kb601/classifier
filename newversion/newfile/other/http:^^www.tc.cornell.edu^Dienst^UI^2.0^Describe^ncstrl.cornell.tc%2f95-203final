 consider a full-rank weighted least squares problem in which the weight matrix is highly ill-conditioned. because of the ill-conditioning, standard methods for solving least-squares problems, qr factorization and the nullspace method for example, break down. g.w. stewart established a norm bound for such a system of equations, indicating that it may be possible to find an algorithm that gives an accurate solution. s.a. vavasis proposed a new definition of stability that is based on this result. he also defined the nsh algorithm for solving this least-squares problem and showed that it satisfies his definition of stability. in this paper, we propose a complete orthogonal decomposition algorithm to solve this problem and show that it is also stable. this new algorithm is simpler and more efficient than the nsh method.

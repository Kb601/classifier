i am a third year 
grad student
from
hong kong,
working towards my doctoral degree in the
computer science department at
the university of washington.
when i'm not at work, i shoot.
(my officemates also like to
shoot,
but in a different way.)

research interests


i am working on validating large software system requirements specifications
using symbolic model checking.
this is joint work with a group of smart people:
richard anderson,
paul beame,
steve burns,
francesmary modugno,
david notkin,
and
jon reese.
recently we analyzed an early version of the
tcas ii 
(traffic alert and collision avoidance system)
system requirements specification written in 
the
requirements state machine language
(rsml)
using a
bdd
based model checker, the 
symbolic model verifier
(smv).
a 
paper appeared in
acm sigsoft '96 (fse 4).


i have continued interests in
systems
and
theory.
when i was an undergrad at
cornell,
i worked with
ken birman 
and robbert van renesse
in the 
horus 
project (a distributed system based on group communications).

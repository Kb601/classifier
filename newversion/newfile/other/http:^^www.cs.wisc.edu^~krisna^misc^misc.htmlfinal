miscellaneous writings, thoughts, and collections

initially, i wanted to organize the following motley collection of
articles into a more refined structure (and this may still happen in the
near future).  a combination of laziness and lack of time prevented me
from doing it.

the collection should give you an indication of my philosophies, thoughts,
and general outlook on life.

please note that not all of these articles are mine.  some are so good
that i thought i must have them here.

comments welcome at krishna@cs.wisc.edu.

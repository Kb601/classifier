professor ray vanderby, jr. uses biomechanical testing equipment to evaluate an orthopedic fixation system for stabilizing lumbar vertebrae. vertebral bodies are being loaded to simulate spinal flexion, compression and torsion. (60k jpg)




 

major testing machines and available instruments fall into these classifications
 

materials and structures

	tension/compression: 20 machines with load capacities ranging from 100 lb. to 1 million lb.
	torsion: 3 table-top machines (5,000 in.-lb.)

 

structures (large)

	tension/compression: 6 machines with load capacities ranging from 5,000 lb. to 1 million lb.

 

vibrations (small specimens)

	one 10-lb. and one 1,200-lb. shaker
	one laser interferometer vibration pattern imager

 

thermoelastic stress analysis

	spate 9000 infrared stress analyzer

 

in addition, all traditional strain-gauge and other stress-strain analysis 
facilities are also available.

for details on vim itself.


 so far, vih has been tested only on unix like systems running x11. given time,
resources and sufficient interest i will try to port it to other systems.
vih has been developed over a short period of time and it has not been tested
extensively. it is distributed in the hope that it will be useful. please feel free to

send

 (january 15, '96) fixed umlauted map in hellenic.c.



binaries and source code are available. i will try to compile and add binaries
for as many architectures as i can. if you have a compiled version of vih
for a system that is not currently in the list i will gladly add a link
to your site.

note that when you download the executables using netscape you are going
to get a screen of incomprehensible text. use the "save as..." option
to get a copy of the executable on your disk.
 finally, a note on copyright. please take the time to read the readme.vih
file which can be found in the source code distribution. briefly the terms
are the following:



 you are welcome to use, share and improve the hellenic
specific part of vih. you are forbidden to forbid anyone else to use, share
and improve what you give them .

although vih can edit in greek you'll need a greek font to be able to
look at the text! you can get some from the

hellenic resources network

or from 

pnevmati@cs.wisc.edu

there is also a local copy of the

"obtaining and installing greek fonts"

from

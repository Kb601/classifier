others
desing and development of applications, database systems, object-oriented programming and methodologies. 


currently working on



heterogeneous process migration
designing and developing a mechanism for process migration on heterogenous distributed computing systems with emphasis on dealing with heterogeneity in the cardinality of registers. this approach simultaneously addresses the both the problems of process state translation and migration point translation and can be accomplished using existing tools/systems.
pvm and hence
developing demos and providing support for hence and pvm users at uab-cis
load distribution and balancing for a parallel search engine
(proposed) developing a mechanism to distribute, monitor and balance load from a parallel search engine for chess, over a network of workstations using pvm.

  1. how do i get a .ps file? 
use the -o flag.

  dvips foo.dvi -o  

the above will create a file named foo.ps




  2. what's a good latex2e book? 
"the latex companion" by goossens, mittelbach, and samarin (isbn
0-201-54199-8) is a good book.  i was able to get a copy from the
university co-op.

if you know a better one, let me know.
 



 3. i've made my own .fmt file, how do i get tex to use it?
the easiest way to do this is to set the texformats enviroment
variable.  let's say i keep my .fmt files in /u/pkn/tex/lib/formats,
then i would set texformats to:

	setenv texformats /u/pkn/tex/lib/formats:

that would search my directory first and the the default directory
(/lusr/tex/lib/tex/formats)




 4. how do i get tex to use the macros in
/p/lib/tex/macros? 
you need to set the  texinputs  enviroment variable to

	setenv texinputs /p/lib/tex/macros:

that will cause tex to look in /p first, then the current directory,
and finally in the default directory (/lusr/tex/lib/tex/macros).  if
you want tex to look in /p last, put the colon before /p/lib/tex/macros




  5. how do i get tex and dvips to use my fonts? 
you need to set  texfonts  to the directory with the .tfm files
in it.   dvips  need  texpks  set to the directory with the .pk
files in it.




  6. how do i print a .dvi file? 
with  dvips .  if you have the  printer  enviroment variable
set you can just type:

	dvips filename

where  filename  is the name of the .dvi file.  if you don't have
 printer  set, use the -p printername  flag

	dvips -p printername filename

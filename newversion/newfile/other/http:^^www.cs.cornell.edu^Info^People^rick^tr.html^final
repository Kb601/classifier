 imacs-94 --  physical elements:
using chains and cell complexes to solve multiple domain pde problems
 a brief description of how  has been used to
encode a lax-wendroff approximation to the 1d euler equations of fluid
flow.

 tr94-1406 --  chain models
and finite element analysis  shows how  is a "programming
language for fem," by developing a three page executable encoding of a
finite element approximation to plane stress using quadratic shape
functions defined over triangles.

tr93-1375 --  chain models of
physical behavior for engineering analysis and design  suggests
that because computers have a preeminent role in engineering analysis
today, computation needs to be explicitly addressed in
mathematical models of engineering systems, and proposes a methodology
for doing this based on algebraic topological concepts.

tr92-1246 --  simlab:
automatically creating physical systems simulators 

describes a computer environment for creation lumped model simulators
from high level specifications.

asme-wam92 -- 
1992 asme winter annual meeting simlab paper 

a later version of tr92-1246 that includes examples from electrical
circuits, rigid body dynamics, etc.

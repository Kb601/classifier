internet movie database.
more information than you can swallow.

the fisher king
house of games, things change (both david mamet)
anything by joel & ethan coen
the fabulous baker boys
annie hall
real genius
29th street
fearless
monty python's life of brian


want to see a movie in ithaca? here are the

movie listings and schedules for the five local theatres.
(most theatres per capita than any other american city, so they say.)
warning: listings often hopelessly out of date.

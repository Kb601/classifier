introduction

the primary function of pdb is to allow the user to schedule planning problems
to be run by the planner, record the actions taken by the planner, and then
reconstruct that information in a meaningful way. since ucpop does extensive
search in plan-space, pdb focuses on recording and presenting plan-space search
trees generated by the planner.

pdb is an interactive application which makes the ucpop planning process more
accessible to the user by the use of graphical interfaces to the planning
process. it is intended to be used in several ways:


domain construction
search control development
planner modification


pdb exists because of the difficulty involved in performing planner research
without adequate visualization tools. in the case of ucpop, users who
were trying to use the planner as well as programmers trying to improve 
and debug the system were having to wade through extensive trace information
generated by the planner. pdb evolved as a way of presenting this information
in a graphical format in order to make these tasks easier.


running pdb
recording plans from the lisp listener
       
to start pdb,  just run (pdb-setup) in the ucpop package.
to start recording planning sessions,  use pdb-record:
(pdb-record &key (record-firings nil))

then invoke the ucpop planner. to stop recording, use pdb-stop:

(pdb-stop)


if you use the def-searchprocedure to wrap around 
search functions,  all planning sessions will be recorded when
even the recording toggle button 
in the shell.  you can turn off the recording by clicking on the 
recording toggle button in the shell
(please refer to the shell window).


       




general window layout

menu and menubar


all windows has a menubar.  on all menubars there is a menu labelled
"windows".  the menu has the following items:



windows
    refresh redisplays the window contents.
    find displays a list of active subwindows.
                 selecting a window will bring it to the front of the
                 screen.
    remove all closes all active subwindows.
    quit close this window.


note: the "remove all" item is only available in the shell window.

commands

you can click on buttons or objects on the screen highlighted by
boxes.  the effects will be discussed in subsequent sections.






planning system overview
the shell window

       

       

the first window opened by pdb is the plan system overview window.
the right hand side of this window maintains a list of recorded planning 
sessions while the left hand side displays the state of the planner.

specifying a problem


in order to start a new planning session, select new session from
the debugger menu.  you will then be asked to specify the problem 
you want to solve and the search method to use via a dialog box. on
the top left of the dialog box is a list of domains. next to it is a
list of problems. when the item ``any'' is selected from the domain
list, all problems are listed: otherwise this list only contains
problems from the currently selected domain. once a problem is
selected, a complete description of the problem is presented in the
area below the domain and problem lists.


setting the search control options

the controls beneath the problem description allow you to specify
various search control options. the first button selects the type of
search to use. when it is pushed in, the planner uses search control
rules to guide search. when it is pushed out, the planner uses a
specific search function. in the latter case, the user must use the
box below this button to specify the search function to be used,
whereas in the former case you will use this box to specify a search
controller.  the other controls allow you to specify whether or not to
record the planning session, whether or not to record search control
rule firings(this slows down planning considerably), as well as the
maximum number of nodes to search.

viewing the results of planning



once you've specified the planning options and clicked the plan
button, pdb calls ucpop to begin planning. the plan system
overview window displays a progress report on planning and returns the
results of planning when done.  these
results include a short description of the last plan searched, which
will be the solution if the planner was successful.  pdb prints
plans in the following manner: the initial state is printed first,
then the steps in order to the goal state. only the preconditions of
the steps are displayed. each precondition has a number to its left
representing the step which supports that precondition. if the plan is
not complete, any unsupported preconditions appear with question marks
instead of numbers on the left,
 while threats are identified by the step number of the threatening
step, shown to the right of the threatened condition.

graphic plan space display
the vcr window



vcr windows provide the user with a graphical depiction of the search
space explored by the planner during a given planning session. once
the user has seleted a session in the plan system overview window,
they can create a vcr window for that session either by selecting
new vcr window from the debug menu, or by pressing
the vcr button in the window itself.  


anatomy of the search tree

most of the vcr window is taken up by a graphical depiction of the
planning trace in the form of a tree
 (we will refer to this as either the planning tree or the search
tree). each node in the tree is a partial plan; the root node plan
contains only the start and goal states, while each subsequent
generation represents one application of the ucpop algorithm. the
children of a given node represent individual solutions or 
refinements generated in the support or protection of a
precondition. the type of refinement is printed beneath each
node. accordingly, each branch of the tree is associated with an
unsupported or threatened precondition(known as a flaw),
which is denoted by a label printed along the branch.  figure
\ref{tree} gives a breakdown of these conventions.



the tree is formatted so that the left hand side of the tree leads to
the last node encountered by the planner. if the solution was found,
this will be the solution path. note that the formatting algorithm
puts nodes near the root of the tree farther apart than nodes at the
leaves, so that sometimes you will have trouble using the vcr window
to view all the children of some nodes. you can solve some of these
problems by changing or restricting the display of various nodes in
the tree via the tree and options menus.


the label 
below nodes refers to the reason for which the plan is made.  for example
in the figure above "s:puton" means a new step "puton" is added, 
"l:0" means a new link to step 0 is added,  and finally
"3

the red node is the currently selected node.  you can press the
left or middle button.

   
    l select node: centers the cursor over this node. if
                 the cursor is already at this node, pdb will open a plan
                 window on that node.
    m describe object: if composer is running, pdb will
     open a composer window on the partial plan associated
                 with this node.
   

the green is a visited node.  a node (plan) is visited if the plan
refined it during planning.
the white node is an unvisited node.  
the planner has not refined the plan during planning.

the word "clear" above the horizontal line represents the open condition
being resolved by the different siblings plans connected by the line.

mouse commands


       
 plan tree nodes
 plan window markers
   
    l: select window: moves the window to another node. this
                 is done by clicking once on the marker to move and once
	     on the node to move to.
      





individual plan display

       

       
the plan window
clicking on a selected node produces a plan window,
which provides a more detailed view of the plan associated with that
node.  the upper part of this window shows the parent, siblings, and
children of the current node, while the lower part describes the plan
at that node. the plan can be viewed in one of two ways: in textual
format the plan is printed in the same way that the results of
planning are returned by ucpop, while in graphic format the steps
are drawn in a partial order from left to right, with lines
representing links connecting effects with preconditions.


navigating the plan window

the small tree at the top of the plan window represents the immediate
``family'' of the current node: its parent,
siblings, and children. it also allows you to navigate the planning tree
simply by selecting any of these nodes: the plan window will
immediately update itself using the node you selected as the new 
current node.

moving the plan window from the vcr

whenever a plan window is opened, a unique id number is assigned to it and 
drawn
next to the node in the vcr window at which it is pointing. you can move the
plan window to point at a different node just by selecting this number once and
then selecting the new node.

 plan tree nodes
   
    l select node pressing the left button on a node
                 causes the window to display the plan associated with
                 that node. the navigational display is updated, as is
                 the vcr window associated with the plan window.
    m describe object if composer is running, a composer
                 window will be opened on the plan associated with the
                 selected node.
   
 plan structures
   
    l choose flaw pressing the left button on a flaw(shown
                 in red) will bring up a plan refinement dialog with the
                 selected flaw already chosen for refinement. clicking
                 the left button on other structures has no effect.
    m describe object if composer is running, a composer
                 window will be opened on the structure associated with
                 the highlighted graphic.
    shift-l move object pressing shift-l over a step in
                 graphic display mode will let you drag the step to a new
                 position. this allows you to view the plan in a more
                 reasonable manner than the automatic layout provides.

the pdb browser is used to provide an organized view and uniform frontend
to inspect different objects related to planning
problems,  for example,  domains, problems,  axioms,  facts,  operators and
sessions.

a simple example

specify a problem

select new session from the debugger menu. you will then
be able to specify the domain and problem to use. try selecting
the uget-paid problem used in the previous section. once you
have done this, you are ready to specify the search control options.

set the search control options

using the new session dialog, set the search function to 
ucpop::bf-control.
this is the same search function used for this problem in the previous example.
for purposes of this example, you do not need to set any of the other options.

view the results of planning

when you click on the plan button, ucpop will begin planning.
the plan system overview window will display a progress report, and 
return the results of planning when done. at this time, you will be able
to see the solution generated by the planner.

open a vcr window
the session you just created should be listed in the plan system overview window. select
this session with the left button and press the vcr button. this will bring up 
a vcr window. you are now able to view the actual search tree explored by the planner.

use the vcr window
experiment with the vcr buttons, 
as well as with scrolling the tree around using the scrollbars.

open a plan window
scroll to the top left corner of the tree and select the node labeled
start. if you click on this node again, a plan window
will appear.  in this case, you will see that the plan has only the
goal step and initial state in it.  this is the first plan created by
the planner. now scroll down to the bottom left node (the solution),
and open a new window on it. to see just how much work went into the
uget-paid solution, go to the options menu, from which
you can select a graphical view of the plan. this view shows each step
in the plan, with preconditions on the left and postconditions on the
right. links are drawn as lines between the steps.  these links were
inserted into the plan one at a time, each one represented by a branch
in the tree.

use the plan window
explore the area around the start node using the plan window. note how
much easier it is to see the relationships between the various nodes compared
to the vcr window, where the whole tree is being displayed at once.



customizations and options
display types
some of the defaults used by pdb are not appropriate for monochrome or
grayscale displays.  on such systems,  pdb provides a set of defaults
that are suitable. 
you can define (setf *pdb-use-colors* nil) in your lisp startup file
(e.g. .clinit.cl on allegro common lisp),  or anytime before loading
pdb.  this will cause pdb to adopt monochrome defaults for its windows.

variables
the following are some user customizable variables.  you can customize pdb
by defining a function and setf it to *pdb-startup-hook*.  
you can define this function in your lisp initialization file;
pdb will call this function when you run pdb-setup.  for example:

(defun my-pdb-init-function ()
   (setf *shell-width* 900)
   (setf *plan-height* 1000))
(setf *pdb-startup-hook* #'my-pdb-init-function)

the table below lists some of the variables that can be set:


 variabledescriptiondefault
	 note
 *shell-width**shell-height*
     width and height of the shell window.
     600400
     it is best not to set these variables below the 
     defaults.

 *vcr-width**vcr-height* 
     width and height of the vcr window. 
     800600

 	*plan-height**plan-width*
	 width and height of the plan window. 
	500400

 	*browser-height**browser-width*
	 width and height of the browser window.
	 500400

 	*vcr-show-progress*  
	when drawing the vcr window,  a window indicating
drawing progress will be displayed if this variable is set to t.
	t




there are other variables that customize colors and fonts as well.  please
refer to the file "pdb/shell.lisp".


known bugs
some of these problems are resulted from bugs in clim2.0 implementation
on allegrocl 4.2.  when you send bug reports,  please check the list
below first.

launching composer with many windows open could hang the x server (have 
to kill the acl process).  sometimes this also happen if you random click on clim
windows when composer windows are being mapped.
transient window/dialog boxes can sometimes disappear/abort after user
  move the window.
in choose flaw dialog,  the flaw actually appears multiple times e.g.
	(clear ?x3) & (clear ?x3).  but they're both selected.  can be
	confusing.
iconify and deiconify doesn't work in our clim2.0 implementation.  
as a result if you
iconify a plan window,  they cannot be brought back automatically by clicking
on the node as intended.
when exiting a vcr window,  all its children plan windows should be 
exiting too.  however this behavior cannot be achieved by the clim2.0
implementation on our system.
the shell window does not resize correctly vertically because of clim2.0
gadget limitations.
plan nodes will not be highlighted (boxed) if num lock or scroll lock key is on.
synchronization problem: asking pdb to display output before the window shows up will
fail.
this is likely a clim bug.  when the shell window refreshes the first time,  pressing random
buttons will cause a "medium-transformation" error.  just continue with the top-level option in
acl.
help documents are slightly outdated and not very helpful.


if pdb should ever crash,  you can either continue by choosing one
of the several continue options provided by your lisp system,  or 
restart pdb.  you can simply restart by issuing (pdb-setup) again.
restarting will erase all previous sessions.  please also include a stack trace
(for example using :zoom in allegro cl) and send a message to 
bug-ucpop@cs.washington.edu.


porting pdb
pdb is written with flexibility in mind,  and could be adopted to other partial order planners that
is similar to ucpop.  pdb has already been ported to a descendent of ucpop,  xii.  work is 
under way to port pdb to other partial order planners such as buridan.

if the planner is very similar to ucpop,  only functions specific to the planner need to be
redefined.  the file vcr-external.lisp contains the interface functions called by pdb to 
display plan components.  you just need to redefine these functions for your planner.
to change the pdb- lisp-interpreter interface  for your planner,  modify the file 
vcr-interface.lisp.

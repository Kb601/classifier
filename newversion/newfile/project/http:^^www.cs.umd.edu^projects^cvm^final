coherent virtual machine (cvm)



coherent virtual machine (cvm)



 the coherent virtual machine (cvm) software
distributed shared memory (dsm) system is being developed here at the
university of maryland.  project goals include:
multiple protocol support - cvm's initial configuration provides four
memory models, single- and multiple-writer versions of
lazy release consistency, sequential consistency, and eager release
consistency.  
extensiblity - cvm will be extensible in that the
source will be freely available, and the modules are being written in c++.
new classes can easily be derived from a master protocol class, allowing
new protocols to be easily incorporated.  
multi-threading support - cvm is multi-threaded, allowing overlap of computation
and communication through context switching.  additionally, we plan to
extend the
multi-threading support to multiprocessor nodes, such as
dec's sable machines.
fault-tolerance - cvm will have a limited amount of fault
tolerance, allowing it to recover from at least one node failure at a time.



status: cvm currently runs on several different unix-like systems,
including sparcs, the sp-2, and digital unix running on dec
sables. multi-threading support is undergoing performance-optimization. cvm
will be freely available, likely under the gnu copyleft.

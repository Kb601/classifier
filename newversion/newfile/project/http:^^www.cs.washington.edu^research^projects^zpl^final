zpl is a new array-based programming language suitable for most 
computations that would previously have been written in fortran 77:


 zpl programs run fast on sequential and parallel computers, 
     without modifications, and without special directives. 
 zpl is machine-independent, so recompilation is all that is 
     necessary to run a zpl program on a new machine. 
 zpl's higher level concepts like arrays, borders, etc. eliminate most 
     of the error-prone indexing and tedious looping typical of f77, c, 
     etc.
 zpl programs are shorter, more easily written, and more easily 
     understood and modified.
 computer scientists will find new concepts in zpl: regions, 
    directions, borders, shattered control-flow, etc.

conclusion:  zpl is ideal for new engineering and scientific programs.

walk-through a small zpl program, or write-compile-run a program from your
machine!

scientific programmers in the area should
consider enrolling in cse 590zp
this autumn. 

if you have programmed in zpl before, check out the recent changes in the language.

introduction


the computer vision research laboratory was established in the computer science department at the
university of
massachusetts in 1974 with the goal of investigating the scientific
principles underlying the construction of integrated vision systems and the
application of vision to problems of real-world importance. the emphasis of our
work is on vision systems that are capable of functioning flexibly and robustly
in complex changing environments. research in the laboratory has been supported
by federal agencies, including nsf, arpa, afosr, and onr, as well as private
industry. the major focus of the laboratory has been on knowledge-driven image
interpretation, the recovery of 3d structure and motion from images and image
sequences, and on computer architectures for vision. the research is performed
in the context of task-oriented funded projects, including arpa, radius, ugv,
learning, rsta, and parallel architectures efforts. a unifying (and unique)
theme within the laboratory has been integration, encompassing the basic
research methodologies as well as driving the development of vision system
research environments.

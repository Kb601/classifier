overview:

in the area of natural language processing systems, we seek to develop a
class of task-oriented natural language processors that enable a human and
machine to collaborate efficiently in problem-solving. we emphasize the
importance of fast, convenient communication with many interacions per
minute using multimodal input (voice, typing and touch screen) and output
(synthesized voice and video screen). our work primarily concentrates on
the developemnt of theories of semantics appropriate for such systems with
particular emphasis on mechanisms for handling complex noun-phrase
resolution, focusing mechanisms, dialogue comprehension, and user models.

in order to test theories, we continuously build natural language
interactive systems and study their performance in typical problem-solving
situations with human subjects. this experimental work provides examples of
human-machine dialogue for study and yields data related to the achieved
level of efficiency.

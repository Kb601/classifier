utcs machine learning research group


 

 the machine learning research group is supervised by  professor ray mooney. our research focuses
on combining empirical and knowledge-based learning techniques,
including applications such as natural language acquisition, knowledge
refinement, and learning for planning.


this group is part of the 
artificial intelligence lab and the computer science department, at
the  university of texas at
austin.

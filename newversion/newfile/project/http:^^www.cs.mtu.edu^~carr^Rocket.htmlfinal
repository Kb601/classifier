description:



the goals of the rocket project are to develop a retargetable compiler for
instruction-level parallel architectures and to develop scheduling and register allocation
algorithms for said architectures.  this project 
intimately
is entwined with the memoria project. current research efforts
include software pipelining, register-sensitive scheduling, and register allocation and
scheduling for partitioned register files.

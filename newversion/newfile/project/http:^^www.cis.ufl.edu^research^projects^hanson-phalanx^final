phalanx parallel active db project




the phalanx parallel active database project


phalanx is an active database project focussing on acheiving high-performance
active rule (trigger) processing for complex triggers using parallel
processing.  the complex triggers we envision have conditions based on events,
selections, joins, aggregates, and user-defined functions on built-in and
extended data types.  an important form of active rules we are considering in
detail are triggers based on geographic data.  



in the phalanx project, we are modifying paradise, a parallel relational
dbms extended with geographic data management capability.  paradise is
currently under development at the university
of wisconsin.



the phalanx project got underway in the fall of 1994.  the principal
investigator is eric hanson.
students working on the project include phd candidates mohktar kandil and nabeel al-fayoumi, and
undergraduate albert vernon.  the
project is funded by grants from at&amp;t global information solutions, and the
air force rome laboratory.



january 1996 talk on proposed parallel trigger system design.  ms powerpoint format.

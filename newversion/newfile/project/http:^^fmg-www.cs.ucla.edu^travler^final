travler: system support for nomadic computing


welcome to the enhanced travler project page.  
the transparent virtual
enviroment (travler) project is one of
several arpa-funded research efforts within the
ucla computer science department.  


 



this nomadic computing research effort focuses on developing models, 
prototyping systems software, and running experiments in support of those
capabilities needed by a mobile user.  in support of these capabilities,
we are involved in the following activities:  virtual networking,
nomadic routing, wireless and nomadic systems simulation, nomadic systems
modeling, predictive caching, user-level replication services,
security encapsulation,
and data consistency. each activity is shown as a piece of the adjacent
pie chart, and a full description of each activity is obtained by clicking
on each piece.  


some of these services are currently being built, some are in the design
phase.  eventually, travler will integrate those services that already exist in reasonable forms (wireless communication protocols, power management software,
secure transmission of data and authentication services) with components
produced by the project and built into the travler framework.  
      

the principal investigators on the travler mobile computing research team are:
 

  
dr. leonard kleinrock 

   
dr. gerald popek  

 
dr. rajive bagrodia  

 
dr. peter reiher
 


team members have published several  
important papers that 
directly relate to research currently underway on travler.  


the travler research team is also conducting simultaneous arpa-funded
research on the following related topics:  large-scale filing and data management
environments (ficus), secure, bilateral 
replicated distributed filing  (truffles),
wireless adaptive mobile information systems (wamis) and
co-base.

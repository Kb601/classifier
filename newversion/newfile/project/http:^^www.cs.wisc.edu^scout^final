surf smarter, not longer. let the internic net scout project at the 
 university
of wisconsin - madison show you the way to only the best--then you can
choose what's best for you. we filter hundreds of internet annoucements
each week looking for the most valuable online resources and network
tools. then we organize, summarize, and annotate the best of what we've
found, and offer it to the internet community in several useful formats.

the goal of net scout is to support effective use of the internet by
educators and researchers in the us. however, everyone is welcome to use
the publications and web sites provided by net scout, and we encourage
feedback and suggestions from the entire internet community.

the three primary services provided include the 
scout report, 
net-happenings, and the
scout toolkit. our
newest project is y'know, 
a web report for students, by students.  

net scout services is located at the 
department of computer sciences at the
university of wisconsin-madison and is a project of the 
internic.

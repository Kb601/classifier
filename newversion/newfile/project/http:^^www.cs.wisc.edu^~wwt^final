wisconsin wind tunnel project




most future massively-parallel computers will be built from
workstation-like nodes and programmed in high-level parallel
languages--like hpf--that support a shared address space in which
processes uniformly reference data.

the wisconsin wind tunnel (wwt) project seeks to develop a consensus about
the middle-level interface--below languages and compilers and above
system software and hardware.  our first proposed interface was

cooperative shared memory, which is an evolutionary extension to
conventional shared-memory software and hardware.  recently, we have
been working on a more revolutionary interface called 
tempest.
tempest provides the mechanisms that allow programmers, compilers, and
program libraries to implement and use message passing, transparent
shared memory, and hybrid combinations of the two.  we are developing
implementations of tempest on a thinking machines cm-5, a cluster of
workstations (wisconsin
cow), and a hypothetical hardware platform.  one approach on cow
uses bus snooping logic, implemented with 
fpgas and sram.
we are collaborating
with the 
wisconsin paradyn project to adapt their performance tools to tempest.

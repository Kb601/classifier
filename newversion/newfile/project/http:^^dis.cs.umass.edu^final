purpose
          the distributed ai lab investigates the problems that arise when multiple
          agents (including computational agents and humans) interact to solve
          interrelated problems. this includes mechanisms for multi-agent coordination,
          organization, and negotiation. the dis lab also investigates the design of
          sophisticated individual control mechanisms for sensor interpretation, acoustic
          signal understanding, real-time scheduling, and resource-constrained scheduling.

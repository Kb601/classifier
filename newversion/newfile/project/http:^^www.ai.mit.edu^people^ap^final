current projects

what the ap group is up to....



   cognitive robotics
       

       we're trying to solve traditional "core" ai problems in the
       context of embodied systems.  we're also trying to understand
       how naturally intelligent systems work!

       
       see the cognitive
       robotics home page for more, including
       
	  neo-modular systems
	  the imagination project
	  natural communication with robots
       


       also see the cog shop
       home page for information on an interrelated project.


    human/systems integration
       computers are great for connecting humans together!

       
	   we've built 
	 sodabot: a software agent environment and construction
	 system.
	  we're using sodabot in the
	      intelligent room. 
	  we're also working (with david
	      karger) on haystack, per 
	      user customization for information retrieval. 
       

      
   education
       
       so much to be done!  
       we're currently rethinking
       cs101 -- see that project's home page for ideas about a new
       approach to introductory computer programming.

       lots of our work involves using inexpensive robotics in education:
       
	  the 1993
	      aaai robot building laboratory. 
	  
	      the
	      6.270 organizer's manual       
	  robotics-based undergraduate computer programming courses.
       

       we also collaborate with the edgerton
       center and the center for advanced 
       educational services 
       (including the virtual campus) at mit.

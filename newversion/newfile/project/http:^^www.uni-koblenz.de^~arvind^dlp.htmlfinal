the long term goal of this
project is to develop a logic programming
system in which disjunction in the head of a clause and non-monotonic
negation in the body of the clause are allowed.  this goal is to be
achieved by appropriately combining classical deduction and 
non-monotonic reasoning systems.  more specifically, the project aims
to develop a disjunctive logic programming system based on
protein
theorem prover developed earlier by our

	artificial intelligence research group.





funding

this project is funded by
deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft (dfg),
a federal government agency that funds various basic research projects in
germany.





persons involved

the project is headed by 
prof.dr. ulrich furbach
and
dr. j&uuml;rgen dix.
two research scientists
dr. ilkka niemel&auml;
and
dr. chandrabose aravindan
are working exculsively on this project.
in addition, katrin erk and
dorothea sch&auml;fer,
students working for their master's degrees, are also involved in this project.
marion herrmann
is the project secretary.







activities


 ilkka niemel&auml;
     was in the programme committe of the
  6th international
     workshop on non-monotonic reasoning, held in timberline,
     oregon, u.s.a., on june 10-12, 1996.
-->
 j&uuml;rgen dix
     organized a
     dagstuhl
   seminar on disjunctive
   logic programming and databases: non-monotonic aspects.

 the group participated in a workshop titled
     
     "integrating nonmonotonicity into automated reasoning systems"
     during 
     ecai '96.  contact
     ilkka niemel&auml;
     for more details.

 the group presented a
     poster
     at the
     poster session
     of
     jicslp '96

 the group presented a
     system description at
     ki '96

 the group is organizing
     lpnmr '97.
     contact
     j&uuml;rgen dix or
     chandrabose aravindan
     for more details.

 the group will be organizing jelia '98.  contact
     j&uuml;rgen dix or
     ulrich furbach
     for more details.

related projects




 this project is founded on an on-going dfg funded project on
     deduction and
     theory reasoning.
     the proposed disjunctive logic programming
     system is to be based on
     protein,
     a theorem prover developed during the course of the
     deduction project.

 for the project on disjunctive logic programming, non-trivial
     case studies in the area of information management are planned,
     and this has been conceived as a different project titled,
     
      "deductive techniques for information management systems."

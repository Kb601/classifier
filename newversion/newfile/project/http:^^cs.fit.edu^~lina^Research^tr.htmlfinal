temporal reasoning


temporal reasoning

this work has been going since 1988 and led by
dr. robert morris and dr. lina khatib. this is in
association with other researchers in the field, who are not
at florida tech, such as dr. peter ladkin and dr. gerard ligozat.
the attention is focused on the 
assumption of ``convexity'' in interval-based reasoning systems, 
and the question
of the effects of removing this assumption to the reasoning
process. this question has motivated the our research 
and impressive results are found. more details can be found
in the following links.

 
  a constraint-based framework for reasoning with non-
convex intervals
  reasoning about recurrence
  using time to reason in dynamic environments

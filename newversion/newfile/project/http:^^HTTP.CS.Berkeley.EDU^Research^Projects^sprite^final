sprite is a research operating system developed at the university of
california, berkeley, by john ousterhout's research group.

sprite is
a distributed operating system that provides a single system image to
a cluster of workstations.  it provides very high file system performance
through client and server caching.  it has process migration to take
advantage of idle machines.  it was used as a testbed for research in
log-structured file systems, striped file systems, crash recovery, and
raid file systems, among other things.

the sprite project has now ended, although sprite is still running on a
few machines.  if you have a decstation 5000/200 or a sparcstation 2, you
could try running sprite off the sprite cd-rom.

john ousterhout has a retrospective
on the sprite project.

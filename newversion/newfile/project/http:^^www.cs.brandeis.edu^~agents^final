the interaction lab is located in the volen center for
complex systems at brandeis
university, and is a part of the computer science
department. our mission is to study interaction dynamics at
different scales, including those within human cognitive systems,
herds of physical robots, animal populations, and economies.  we seek
to understand the mechanisms that generate complex group behaviors
from local interactions between the agents/components/individuals, and
to develop methods for principled synthesis and analysis of complex
group behavior.

research 

our work involves the following three areas:
multi-agent robotics: including dynamic task division, specialization, learning behaviors and
social rules, distributed spatial representations, synthesis and 
analysis of multi-robot controllers, and new approaches to
multi-robot systems. using the 24 mobile robots and a robot simulator
with full dynamics.

multi-agent systems

covering the topics of cooperation
and competition, dominance 
hierarchies, modeling markets,
economies, and ecologies with non-rational agents, and developing
methods for synthesizing and analyzing complex group behavior.

multi-model representations: learning by imitation 
(involving perception, representation, motor control and 
sensory-motor mappings), learning new motor behaviors,
adapting internal motor programs, attention, and analysis of moving
images. using a fully dynamic human torso simulation. the importance 
of representational 
recoding is also discussed in a new paper (available 
soon!).

the tibbit project






timing insensitive binary to 
binary translation


the tibbit project focuses on performing automated binary-code translation 
and migration of applications across widely different architectures, and
automatically compensating for implicit time-based dependencies between 
the application and the speed of the underlying hardware.  the tibbit project 
is primarily concerned with the automated migration of embedded real-time 
applications.
